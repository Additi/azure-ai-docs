# Accessing data in storage accounts securely via trusted service exception

Indexers whose data sources use the search service's identity to access storage account data, can utilize the ["trusted service exception"](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#exceptions) capability offered by Azure storage to "by pass" any firewall rules. This mechanism enables customers who are unable to grant [indexer access via IP firewall rules](search-indexer-howto-access-ip-restricted.md) (presumably because the search service and storage accounts are in the same region) a simple, no-cost alternative to access data in network secured storage accounts.

> [!NOTE]
> Accessing storage account via the system assigned identity of a search service is still in preview, provided without a service level agreement, and is not recommended for production workloads.

## Step 1: Configure connection to the storage account via identity

Follow the details outlined in [this how-to guide](search-howto-managed-identities-storage.md) to set up the indexers to access storage accounts via the search service's identity.

## Step 2: Allow trusted Microsoft services to access the storage account

In the Azure portal, via the "Firewalls and Virtual Networks" tab of the storage account management blade, ensure that the option "Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account" is checked. This will only permit the specific instance of the search service, which has been assigned the appropriate access permissions to the storage account, to bypass the firewall rules.
