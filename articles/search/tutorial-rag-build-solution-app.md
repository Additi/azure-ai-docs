# Deployment checklist for next-level testing (RAG tutorial - Azure AI Search)

In this lesson, review options for setting up simple web front-end for a RAG prototype. A simple app is useful for scenario testing with users and stakeholders. This lesson also provides a deployment checklist for broader distribution.

Key points:

- Is your index ready for deployment? Clean up (can you remove fields? Make some non-retrievable?). Rebuild is probably required.
- Remove any permissions you don't need (for example, to models or data sources you aren't using)
- Provide source code for a simple web app that has input, output
- Provide steps for deploying
- Create an index alias so that you can swap out changes on the backend
- Link to securing app/granting access
- Link to "Get started with chat security" article and sample
- Link to ???
