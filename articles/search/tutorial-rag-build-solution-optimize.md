# Optimize using vector compression and reduced storage (RAG tutorial - Azure AI Search)

In this tutorial, learn the techniques for reducing index size, with a focus on vector compression and storage. 

Key points:

- scalar
- stored false, retrievable false
- filterable, sortable false for non-vector
- narrow data types
- hnsw vs eknn, does hnsw product a smaller footprint?
