## New service name for Azure Search

Azure Search is now renamed to **Azure Cognitive Search** to reflect the expanded use of cognitive skills and AI processing in core operations. While cognitive skills add new capabilities, using AI is strictly optional. You can continue to use Azure Cognitive Search without AI to build rich, full text search solutions over private, heterogenous content in an index that you create and manage in the cloud.

API versions, Nuget packages, namespaces, and endpoints are unchanged. Your existing search solutions are unaffected by the service name change.

## Feature announcements

November 4, 2019 - Ignite Conference

+ [Knowledge store](knowledge-store-concept-intro.md) is now generally available. If you previously used `api-version=2019-05-06-Preview` to create a knowledge, you can now drop the `-Preview` from the version designation.

+ [Power BI templates](knowledge-store-connect-power-bi.md) can jumpstart your visualizations and analysis of enriched content in a knowledge store in Power BI desktop.

+ Incremental processing, now in preview, allows you to process and retain content in chunks so that you can build up an index or a knowledge store in phases. This is especially useful if you have image content that you previously analyzed. The output of costly analysis is stored and then used as a basis for additional indexing or enrichment.

+ Lookup Skill is a cognitive skill used during indexing that calls a specific document by its ID for processing within a skillset.

+ Document Cracking Skill is a cognitive skill used during indexing that allows you to extract the contents of a file from within a skillset. Previously, document cracking occurred prior to skillset execution. With the addition of this skill, you can perform this operation within skillset execution.
