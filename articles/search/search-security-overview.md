# Service and data security in Azure Search


## Encryption at rest 

Azure Search provides built-in encryption at rest with full [AICPA SOC 2 compliance](https://www.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report.html) for all new services created after December 31 2017 in all regional data centers offering Azure Search resources.

Microsoft Azure data centers are physically secure, with a rich infrastructure providing oversight, internal auditing and forensics, service and data isolation, redundancy, and highly availability with 99.9% uptime service level agreements.
