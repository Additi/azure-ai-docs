<!-- Robert, for private preview, we relied on quickstarts and demos to explain how to get vectors into an index, but customers will expect to see a how-to from us that explains this basic task.  You would mention that vector generation isn't part of it, and link out to the other how-to. You'd emphasize that we don't have vector indexes, just vector fields in an index.  -->
