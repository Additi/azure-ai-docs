# Accessing indexer resources via Azure network security mechanisms

Azure Cognitive Search indexers can access several different resources for its execution. The various Azure resource types accessed by an indexer in a typical run can include one or more of the following:

| Resource | Purpose within indexer run |
| --- | --- |
| Azure Storage (blobs, tables, ADLS Gen 2) | Data Source |
| Azure Storage (blobs, tables) | Caching temporary state of an indexer; storing knowledge store projections from a skillset |
| Cosmos DB (various APIs) | Data Source |
| Azure SQL | Data Source |
| SQL server on Azure IaaS VMs | Data Source |
| SQL managed instances | Data Source |
| Azure functions | Host for custom web api skills |
| Cognitive service resource | Attached to skillset that will be used to bill enrichment beyond the 20 free documents limit |

> [!NOTE]
> The cognitive service resource attached to a skillset is used for billing, based on the enrichments performed and written into the search index. It is not used for accessing the Cognitive Services APIs. Access from an indexer's enrichment pipeline to Cognitive Services APIs occurs via a secure communication channel, where data is strongly encrypted in transit and is never stored at rest.

Customers can secure these resources via several network isolation mechanisms offered by Azure. With the exception of cognitive service resource, indexers have limited ability to access all other resources even if they are network isolated. The following describes the level of indexer support:

| Resource | IP Restriction | Private endpoint (when supported, availability is gated) |
| --- | --- | ---- |
| Azure storage (blobs, tables, ADLS Gen 2) | Supported only if the storage account and search service are in different regions | Supported |
| Cosmos DB - SQL API | Supported | Supported |
| Cosmos DB - Cassandra, Mongo and Gremlin API | Supported | Unsupported |
| Azure SQL | Supported | Supported |
| SQL server on Azure IaaS VMs | Supported | N/A |
| SQL managed instances | Supported | N/A |
| Azure functions | Supported | Supported, only for certain SKUs of Azure functions |

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the options listed above, for network secured Azure storage accounts, customers can leverage the fact that Azure Cognitive Search is a [trusted Microsoft service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#trusted-microsoft-services). This means that a specific search service can bypass virtual network or IP restrictions on the storage account and can access data in the storage account, if the appropriate role based access control is enabled on the storage account. Details are available in the [how to guide](search-indexer-howto-access-trusted-service-exception.md). This option can be utilized instead of the IP restriction route, in case either the storage account or the search service cannot be moved to a different region.

When considering the secure access mechanism that an indexer should use, consider the following:

- [Service endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview) will not be supported for any Azure resource.
- A search service cannot be provisioned into a specific virtual network - this functionality will not be offered by Azure Cognitive Search.
- When indexers utilize private endpoints to access resources, additional [private link charges](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/private-link) may apply.

## Indexer execution environment

Azure Cognitive Search indexers are capable of efficiently extracting content from data sources, adding enrichments to the extracted content, optionally generating projections before writing the results to the search index. Depending on the amount of responsibilities assigned to an indexer, it can run in one of two environments:

1. An environment private to a specific search service. Indexers running in such environments share resources with other workloads (such as other customer initiated indexing or querying workload). Typically only indexers that do not require a lot of resources (for eg., do not use a skillset) run in this environment.
2. A multi-tenant environment that hosts indexers that are resource hungry, such as ones with a skillset. This is to ensure optimal performance of the indexer whilst ensuring that the search service resources are available for other workload. This multi-tenant environment is managed and secured by Azure Cognitive Search, at no extra cost to the customer.

For any given indexer run, Azure Cognitive Search determines the best environment in which to run the indexer.

## Granting access to indexer IP ranges

If the resource that your indexer is trying to access is restricted to only a certain set of IP ranges, then you need to expand the set to include the possible IP ranges from which an indexer request can originate. As stated above, there are 2 possible environments in which indexers run and from which access requests can originate. You will need to add the IP addresses of __both__ environments for indexer access to work.

1. To obtain the IP address of the search service specific "private" environment, `ping` (or `nslookup`) the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your search service. The FQDN of a search service in the public cloud, for example, would be `<service-name>.search.windows.net`. This information is available on the Azure portal.

2. The IP addresses of the multi-tenant environments are available via the `AzureCognitiveSearch` service tag. [Azure service tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) have a published range of IP addresses for each service - this is available via a [discovery API (preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#use-the-service-tag-discovery-api-public-preview) or a [downloadable JSON file](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview#discover-service-tags-by-using-downloadable-json-files). In either case, IP ranges are broken down by region - you can pick only the IP ranges assigned for the region in which your search service is provisioned.

For certain data sources, the service tag itself can be used directly instead of enumerating the list of IP ranges (the IP address of the search service still needs to be used explicitly). These data sources restrict access by means of setting up a [Network Security Group rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/security-overview), which natively support adding a service tag, unlike IP rules such as the ones offered by Azure Storage, CosmosDB, Azure SQL etc., The data sources that support the ability to utilize the `AzureCognitiveSearch` service tag directly in addition to search service IP address are:

1. SQL server on IaaS VMs. Details outlined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-iaas-to-azure-search-using-indexers#restrict-access-to-the-azure-cognitive-search)

2. SQL managed instances. Details outlined [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-howto-connecting-azure-sql-mi-to-azure-search-using-indexers#verify-nsg-rules)

Details are described in the [how to guide](search-indexer-howto-access-ip-restricted.md).

## Granting access via private endpoints

Indexers can utilize private endpoints to access resources, access to which are locked down either to select virtual networks or do not have any public access enabled (i.e., no one can access it). This capability is gated - please fill out this form: @TODO MARK@ to request access.

This functionality is only available for paid services.

### Step 1: Create a private endpoint to the secure resource

Customers should call the search management operation, [Create or Update shared private link resource API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchmanagement/sharedprivatelinkresources/createorupdate) in order to create a private endpoint connection to their secure resource (for example, a storage account). Traffic that goes over this private endpoint connection will originate only from the virtual network that's in the search service specific "private" indexer execution environment.

Azure Cognitive Search will validate that callers of this API have permissions to approve private endpoint connection requests to the secure resource. For example, if you request a private endpoint connection to a storage account which you do not have access to, this call will be rejected.

### Step 2: Approve the private endpoint connection

When the call to create or update a shared private link resource succeeds, a private endpoint connection will be created in a "Pending" state. No traffic flows over the connection yet.
The caller is then expected to locate this request on their secure resource and "Approve" it. Typically, this can be done either via the Portal or via the [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/virtualnetwork/privatelinkservices/updateprivateendpointconnection).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Cognitive Search will poll the status of the private endpoint connection periodically. To not spam the secure resource, this polling interval (for now) is quite conservative. It can take up to 30 minutes for Azure Cognitive Search to pick up the modified state of a private endpoint connection. To find out what Azure Cognitive Search thinks is the state of the private endpoint connection, utilize the [GET API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchmanagement/sharedprivatelinkresources/get).

Once Azure Cognitive Search has picked up the "Approved" state of a private endpoint, traffic will flow over the connection.

### Step 3: Force indexers to run in the "private" environment

Customers can override the default indexer execution environment behavior (in which Azure Cognitive Search determines the best environment in which to run indexers), by setting the indexer configuration property `executionEnvironment`.

To enable indexers to access resources via private endpoint connections, it is mandatory to set the `executionEnvironment` of the indexer to `"Private"` to ensure that all indexer runs will be able to utilize the private endpoint. This is because any customer created private endpoint is provisioned within the "private" search service specific environment.

```json
    {
      "name" : "myindexer",
      ... other indexer properties
      "parameters" : {
          ... other parameters
          "configuration" : {
            ... other configuration properties
            "executionEnvironment": "Private"
          }
        }
    }
```

Doing so has performance implications on the stability of the search service and therefore the ability to force indexers to run in the "private" environment is restricted to certain search service SKUs, outlined below:

| Resource | Free | Basic | S1 | S2 | S3 | S3 HD | L1 | L2
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Private endpoint indexer support | N/A | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| Private endpoint indexer support with cognitive search skillsets | N/A | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |

Once you have an approved private endpoint to a resource, indexers that are set to be "private" attempt to obtain access via the private endpoint connection.

Customers can only create a fixed number of private endpoint connections based on their service SKU, which may limit how many secure resources indexers can access.
This limit is outined below:

| Resource | Free | Basic | S1 | S2 | S3 | S3 HD | L1 | L2
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum private endpoints | N/A | 10 or 30 | 100 | 400 | 400 | N/A | N/A | N/A |

These steps are described in greater detail in the [how to guide](search-indexer-howto-access-private.md).
