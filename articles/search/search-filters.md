# Filters in Azure Search 

A *filter* reduces the surface area of an Azure Search query operation based on criteria you provide. Unfiltered search is open-ended and inclusive of all documents in the index. Filtered search creates a subset of documents for a more focused query operation. For example, you could restrict full text search to just the Japanese strings in a multi-lingual search app.

In this article, we explain filter design patterns and general usage requirements for text and numeric filters.

## Filter definition

A filter is an instruction used to reduce the pool of documents for further query operations. The criteria provided in the filter qualifies a document for inclusion or exclusion in a downstream processing operation (namely, evaluating content for relevance, scoring, ranking, and returning results to the calling application). 

Filters are OData expressions embedded in a search query as an **$filter** argument. Filter composition can be as simple as a string or field. Alternatively, it could be a complex expression with multiple parts, where each part resolves to an individual subquery in a query tree. 

Maximum limit on the filter expression is the maximum limit on the request: 16 MB for POST, 8 KB for GET.

## Filter design patterns

There are several patterns for constructing filters, presented below from simplest to complex.

+ Standalone $filter, without a query string, useful when the filter expression is able to fully qualify the matching documents. Without a query string, there is no lexical or linguistic analysis, no scoring, no ranking.

+ Combination of query string and $filter, where the filter creates the subset and the query string provides the input for full text search over the filtered subset. This is the most common code pattern.

  A filter could be a designation of which fields to target for full text search. In the multi-lingual app scenario, the filter specifies fields containing translated strings (descriptionsFR, descriptionsEN, and so forth), and the query string provides the terms inputs in that language.

+ Composite filter expressions, where you have multiple filters, subject to the 16 MB limit on the request. As you can imagine, each additional $filter contributes to latency. This is not a common use case, but we include it here for completeness.


## Field requirements

Field attribute must be filterable.

Numeric or text (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types)

DateTimeOffset??  collection?? Complex model types??

For text filters based on contents within a string field, low cardinality fields are the best candidates. Fields containing a relatively small number of values (such as a list of colors, countries, or brand names), and the number of conditions is also small (color eq ‘blue’ or color eq ‘yellow’). The performance benefit comes from caching, which Azure Search does for queries most likely to be repeated.

Possible reindex requirements if a non-filterable field suddenly becomes filterable. (see updateAndMerge documents)

Changing a field definition is not a metadata change; it is an adjustment to the physical structure of the index. In Azure Search, all allowed access paths are indexed for fast query speed, which necessitates a rebuild of data structures when you might not expect it. Fortunately, you can rebuild individual fields using a merge operation in indexing batches to only send the document key and the new value, leaving the rest of each document intact. ("merge" is documented here for .NET SDK, here for the REST API).

## How filters are used

Filters are foundational to several search experiences, including "find near me", faceted navigation, and security filters that only show documents a user is allowed to see. If you are implementing these experiences, a filter is required. It's the filter on the query expression that provides the geo.location coordinates, the facet category selected by the user, or the security ID of the requestor.

At query time, filter criteria are added to the query tree first and evaluated first. 

## When to use a filter

A filter provides criteria for shrinking the surface area of a search operation. Documents are either included or excluded based on the criteria.

1. Use a filter if the search experience comes with a filter requirement:
* Facets require a filter as the mechanism for classifying results on a per-facet basis.
* Geo-search is implemented as a filter.
* Security filters

2. Use a filter to prioritize/sort/group on numeric data. Numeric fields aren't searchable or subject to full text search. If you need to manipulate results based on a numeric field (rather than rely on full text search and lexical analysis to do the right thing), use a filter.

3. You need to use operands that are not available in a search string. A query string can include AND, OR, NOT, precedence -- but if you need 'between x and y', or 'greater than x', etc. you need a filter expression.

4. From a code design standpoint, keep the base query constructor simple and flexible, so you offload specialized logic to filters.

## Text filters

Text filters -- case-sensitive. Not analyzed. Access privileges, used to limit indexes and articles by user identity, are a derivative of text filtering.

For text filters, the contents of the expression do not undergo linguistic analysis, but are added verbatim to the query tree.

Use search.in if possible.
Applies to: api-version=2016-09-01-Preview, api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
An OData function, used to pass in a comma-delimited list of strings. The strings comprise the filter criteria, which are applied to every field in scope for the query.

Use $filter if the text is a pattern (regular expression) or has a logic component.

Filter expressions are not analyzed so if the expression includes text, it's important to understand that text is added to the query tree as given. 

Case-sensitive.


There is no lexical analysis on filter criteria. Strings are added to the query tree as provided by your application.



There are two mechanisms in Azure Search for adding filters to search queries. 

| Approach | Description | Query parser requirement | Availability |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| [search.in()](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search) | An OData function passing a comma-delimited list of strings for text filtering | [Full Lucene parser](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/lucene-query-syntax-in-azure-search) | In preview, [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/search-documents) only |
| [$filter parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search) | OData filter expression, one per request | [Simple parser](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/simple-query-syntax-in-azure-search) | Generally available, [REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/search-documents) and [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.models.searchparameterspayload.filter) |

Use the **search.in** function if the filter is raw text to be matched on values in a given field, assuming it is searchable, retrievable, and not otherwise excluded from the query. This approach is designed for speed. You can expect sub-second response time for hundreds to thousands of values. While there is no explicit limit on the number of items you can pass to search.in, latency increases in proportion to the number of strings you provide.  

Use the **$filter** parameter for everything else. A filter expression is intended for static filtering, where you control the user interaction model and thus know whether the search page is for a given language, or whether the user made selections in a faceted navigation structure.


## Numeric filters

Numeric filters -- fast. Numeric fields are not searchable in the context of full text search. so if you have numeric data, the assumption is that you will use them for ranges, facets, sort, group. Documents that contain numeric fields (price, size, SKU, ID) will include the numeric values if the field is marked Returnable, but its not searchable (i.e., if enter $99.99 as a search term, you won't get all items priced at $99.99. Instead, you will get items that have 9s in string fields of the document)

use $filter

you require an expression. You can create multiple filter expressions, up to XXXX, but each one can have only one set of criteria. If you want to search on multiple phrases, for example a city name, a type of hotel, ...

TBD
```
$filter=[string] (optional)
```
A structured search expression in standard OData syntax. When calling via POST, this parameter is named filter instead of $filter. 


## Next steps

You can try **Search explorer** in the portal to submit queries with **$filter** parameters. The following examples work against the built-in sample index, but can be easily adapted to work with any index published to your service.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal]() and open the search dashboard. If it isn't pinned to the dashboard, you can search
