# Azure security baseline for Azure Cognitive Search

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark](../security/benchmarks/overview.md) to Azure Cognitive Search. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Azure Cognitive Search. **Controls** not applicable to Azure Cognitive Search have been excluded. To see how Azure Cognitive Search completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Azure Cognitive Search security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network security](../security/benchmarks/security-control-network-security.md).*

### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33328.).

**Guidance**: Ensure that all Microsoft Azure Virtual Network subnet deployments have a network security group applied with  rules to implement a "least privileged" access scheme. Deploy Azure Cognitive Search with an Azure private endpoint. Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to an Azure service. Private endpoints use a private IP address from your virtual network which allows for secure private communication to your search service over your private network.  

Azure Cognitive Search also supports additional network security functionality for managing network access control lists. Configure your search service to only allow communication with trusted sources by restricting access from specific public IP address ranges using its firewall capability.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Yes

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.2: Monitor and log the configuration and traffic of virtual networks, subnets, and NICs

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33329.).

**Guidance**: Cognitive Search cannot be deployed directly into a virtual network, but if your client application or data sources are in a virtual network, you can monitor and log traffic for those in-network components, including requests sent to a search service in the cloud. Standard recommendations include enabling a network security group flow log and sending logs to either Azure Storage or a Log Analytics workspace. You could optionally use Traffic Analytics for insights into traffic patterns.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Currently not available

**Responsibility**: Customer

### 1.10: Document traffic configuration rules

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33337.).

**Guidance**: You can deploy Azure Cognitive Search with an Azure private endpoint to integrate your search service with a virtual network.  Use resource tags for network security groups and other resources related to network security and traffic flow. For individual network security group rules, use the "Description" field to document the rules that allow traffic to/from a network. 

Use any of the built-in Azure Policy definitions related to tagging, such as "Require tag and its value" to ensure that all resources are created with tags and to notify you of existing untagged resources. 

You can use Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI to look-up or perform actions on resources based on their tags.

## Identity and access control

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity and access control](../security/benchmarks/security-control-identity-access-control.md).*

### 3.1: Maintain an inventory of administrative accounts

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33349.).

**Guidance**: Azure role-based access control (RBAC) allows you to manage access to Azure resources through role assignments. You can assign these roles to users, groups service principals and managed identities. There are pre-defined built-in roles for certain resources, and these roles can be inventoried or queried through tools such as Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal.

Azure Cognitive Search roles are associated with permissions that support service level management tasks.  These roles do not grant access to the service endpoint.  Access to operations such as index management, index population, and queries on search data are available via api-keys.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/33410.).

**Guidance**: Azure Security Center assigns a severity to each alert to help you prioritize which alerts should be investigated first. The severity is based on how confident Security Center is in the finding or the analytically used to issue the alert as well as the confidence level that there was malicious intent behind the activity that led to the alert.

Additionally, mark subscriptions using tags and create a naming system to identify and categorize Azure resources, especially those processing sensitive data. It's your responsibility to prioritize the remediation of alerts based on the criticality of the Azure resources and environment where the incident occurred.
