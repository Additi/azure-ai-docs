# Filters in vector queries

You can set a [vector filter modes on a vector query](vector-search-how-to-query.md) to specify whether you want filtering before or after query execution. Filters are set on and iterate over string and numeric fields attributed as `filterable` in the index, but the effects of filtering determine *what* the vector query executes over: the searchable space, or the documents in the search results.

This article describes each filter mode and provides guidance on when to use each one.

## Prefilter mode

Prefiltering applies filters before query execution, reducing the search surface area over which the vector search algorithm looks for similar content. In a vector query, `preFilter` is the default.

## Postfilter mode

Post-filtering applies filters after query execution, narrowing the search results.

## Benchmark testing of vector filter modes

To understand the conditions under which one filter mode performs better than the other, we ran a series of tests to evaluate query outcomes over small, medium, and large indexes.

+ Small (100,000 documents, 2.5-GB index, 1536 dimensions)
+ Medium (1 million documents, 25-GB index, 1536 dimensions)
+ Large (1 billion documents, 1.9-TB index, 96 dimensions)

Indexes had an identical construction: one key field, one vector field, one filter field.

In queries, we used an identical filter for both prefilter and postfilter operations. We used a simple filter to ensure that variations in performance were due to filtering mode, and not filter complexity.

Outcomes were measured in Queries Per Second (QPS).

### Takeaways

+ Prefiltering is almost always slower than postfiltering, except on small indexes where performance is approximately equal.

+ On larger datasets, prefiltering is orders of magnitude slower.

+ Prefilter is the default. If you're working with larger indexes, we recommend setting the `vectorFilterMode` to `postFilter`.

### Details

+ Given a dataset with 100,000 vectors at 1536 dimensions:
  + When filtering more than 30% of the dataset, prefiltering and postfiltering were comparable.
  + When filtering less than 0.1% of the dataset, prefiltering was about 50% slower than postfiltering.

+ Given a dataset with 1 million vectors at 1536 dimensions:
  + When filtering more than 30% of the dataset, prefiltering was about 30% slower.
  + When filtering less than 2% of the dataset, prefiltering was about seven times slower.

+ Given a dataset with 1 billion vectors at 96 dimensions:
  + When filtering more than 5% of the dataset, prefiltering was about 50% slower.
  + When filtering less than 10% of the dataset, prefiltering was about seven times slower.

The following graph shows prefilter relative QPS, computed as prefilter QPS divided by postfilter QPS. The horizontal axis represents the filtering rate, or the percentage of candidate documents after applying the filter. For example, a value of 0.5 on the vertical axis means prefiltering was 50% slower than postfiltering.
