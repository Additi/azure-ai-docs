1. At a Bash terminal, download your forked sample application to your local computer. 

    Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-ALIAS` with your GitHub alias. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ALIAS/azure-search-javascript-samples
    ```

1. At the same Bash terminal, go into your forked repository for this website search example:

    ```bash
    cd azure-search-javascript-samples/search-website-functions-v4
    ```

1. Use the Visual Studio Code command, `code .` to open your forked repository. The remaining tasks are accomplished from Visual Studio Code, unless specified.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```
