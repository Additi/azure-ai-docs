# Azure Search Service REST API: Version 2016-09-01-Preview
This article is the reference documentation for `api-version=2016-09-01-Preview`. This preview extends the current generally available version, [api-version=2016-09-01](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn798935.aspx), by providing the following experimental features:

* [Synonyms API](search-synonyms.md) to upload synonym maps and expand search.
* [`moreLikeThis` query parameter](search-more-like-this.md) to find documents that are relevant to a specific document.

> [!NOTE]
> Preview features are available for testing and experimentation with the goal of gathering feedback and are subject to change. **We strongly advise against using preview APIs in production applications.**

Azure Search service is available in multiple versions. Please refer to [Search Service Versioning](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn864560.aspx) for details.
