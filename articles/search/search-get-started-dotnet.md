Create a C# console application that creates, loads, and queries an Azure Search index using Visual Studio and the [.NET SDK](https://aka.ms/search-sdk). This article explains how to create the application step by step. Alternatively, you could run a completed application. To download a copy, go to [Azure-Search-dotnet-samples repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-dotnet-samples).

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

The following services, tools, and data are used in this quickstart. 

+ [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), any edition. Sample code and instructions were tested on the free Community edition.\

+ [DotNetHowTo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetHowTo) provides the sample solution, a .NET Core console application written in C#, located in the Azure samples GitHub repository. Download and extract the solution. By default, solutions are read-only. Right-click the solution and clear the read-only attribute so that you can modify files. Data is included in the solution.

+ [Create an Azure Search service](search-create-service-portal.md) or [find an existing service](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.Search%2FsearchServices) under your current subscription. You can use a free service for this quickstart.

## Get a key and URL

Calls to the service require a URL endpoint and an access key on every request. A search service is created with both, so if you added Azure Search to your subscription, follow these steps to get the necessary information:

1. [Sign in to the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and in your search service **Overview** page, get the URL. An example endpoint might look like `https://mydemo.search.windows.net`.

2. In **Settings** > **Keys**, get an admin key for full rights on the service. There are two interchangeable admin keys, provided for business continuity in case you need to roll one over. You can use either the primary or secondary key on requests for adding, modifying, and deleting objects.

   Get the query key as well. It's a best practice to issue query requests with read-only access.

![Get an HTTP endpoint and access key](media/search-fiddler/get-url-key.png "Get an HTTP endpoint and access key")

All requests require an api-key on every request sent to your service. Having a valid key establishes trust, on a per request basis, between the application sending the request and the service that handles it.

## Set up your environment

Begin by opening Visual Studio and creating a new Console App project that can run on .NET Core.

### Install NuGet packages

The [Azure Search .NET SDK](https://aka.ms/search-sdk) consists of a few client libraries for creating and using objects, all without having to deal with the details of HTTP and JSON serialization. Client libraries are distributed as NuGet packages.

For this project, you will need to install version 9 of the `Microsoft.Azure.Search` NuGet package and the latest `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet package.

1. Install the `Microsoft.Azure.Search` NuGet package using the Package Manager console in Visual Studio. In **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager**, select **Package Manager Console**. 

1. Navigate to the  [Microsoft.Azure.Search NuGet package page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Search), select version 9, and copy the Package Manager command. 

1. Run this command in the Package Manager console.

1. To install `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json`, select **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...**. Select **Browse** and search for the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet package. 

1. Once you've found it, select the package, select your project, confirm the version is the latest stable version, then select **Install**.

## Add Azure Search service information

1. In Solution Explorer, right click on the project and select **Add** > **New Item...** . Name the file `appsettings.json` and select **Add**. 

2. Add the file to your output directory. Right click on `appsettings.json` and select **Properties**. Change the value of **Copy to Output Directory** to **Copy of newer**.

3. Copy the following JSON into your new JSON file. Replace the search service name (YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME), query API key (YOUR-QUERY-API-KEY), and admin API key (YOUR-ADMIN-API-KEY) with valid values. 

```json
{
  "SearchServiceName": "<YOUR-SEARCH-SERVICE-NAME>",
  "SearchServiceAdminApiKey": "<YOUR-ADMIN-API-KEY>",
  "SearchServiceQueryApiKey": "<YOUR-QUERY-API-KEY>",
}
```

<a name="CreateSearchServiceClient"></a>

## Create a client

To start using the Azure Search .NET SDK, create an instance of the `SearchServiceClient` class. This class has several constructors. The one you want takes your search service name and a `SearchCredentials` object as parameters. `SearchCredentials` wraps your api-key.

In Program.cs file, add the following code. It creates a new `SearchServiceClient` using values from the application's config file (appsettings.json).

```csharp
private static SearchServiceClient CreateSearchServiceClient(IConfigurationRoot configuration)
{
    string searchServiceName = configuration["SearchServiceName"];
    string adminApiKey = configuration["SearchServiceAdminApiKey"];

    SearchServiceClient serviceClient = new SearchServiceClient(searchServiceName, new SearchCredentials(adminApiKey));
    return serviceClient;
}
```

`SearchServiceClient` has an `Indexes` property. This property provides all the methods you need to create, list, update, or delete Azure Search indexes.

> [!NOTE]
> The `SearchServiceClient` class manages connections to your search service. In order to avoid opening too many connections, try to share a single instance of `SearchServiceClient` in your application if possible. Its methods are thread-safe to enable such sharing.
>

<a name="DefineIndex"></a>

## 1 - Create an index

The example code in this article uses the synchronous methods of the Azure Search .NET SDK for simplicity. We recommend that you use the asynchronous methods in your own applications to keep them scalable and responsive. For example, in the examples above you could use `CreateAsync` and `DeleteAsync` instead of `Create` and `Delete`.

A single call to the `Indexes.Create` method creates an index. This method takes as a parameter an `Index` object that defines an Azure Search index. Create an `Index` object and initialize it as follows:

1. Set the `Name` property of the `Index` object to the name of your index.

1. Set the `Fields` property of the `Index` object to an array of `Field` objects. The easiest way to create the `Field` objects is by calling the `FieldBuilder.BuildForType` method, passing a model class for the type parameter. A model class has properties that map to the fields of your index. This mapping allows you to bind documents from your search index to instances of your model class.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't plan to use a model class, you can still define your index by creating `Field` objects directly. You can provide the name of the field to the constructor, along with the data type (or analyzer for string fields). You can also set other properties like `IsSearchable`, `IsFilterable`, to name a few.
>
>

It is important that you keep your search user experience and business needs in mind when designing your index. Each field must be assigned the [attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/Create-Index) that control which search features (filtering, faceting, sorting, and so forth) apply to which fields. For any property you do not explicitly set, the `Field` class defaults to disabling the corresponding search feature unless you specifically enable it.

### Define the index schema

In this example, the index name is "hotels-csharp" and fields are defined using a model class. Each property of the model class has attributes that determine the search-related behaviors of the corresponding index field. The model class is defined as follows:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.Azure.Search;
using Microsoft.Azure.Search.Models;
using Microsoft.Spatial;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

// The SerializePropertyNamesAsCamelCase attribute is defined in the Azure Search .NET SDK.
// It ensures that Pascal-case property names in the model class are mapped to camel-case
// field names in the index.
[SerializePropertyNamesAsCamelCase]
public partial class Hotel
{
    [System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Key]
    [IsFilterable]
    public string HotelId { get; set; }

    [IsFilterable, IsSortable, IsFacetable]
    public double? BaseRate { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable]
    public string Description { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable]
    [Analyzer(AnalyzerName.AsString.FrLucene)]
    [JsonProperty("description_fr")]
    public string DescriptionFr { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable, IsFilterable, IsSortable]
    public string HotelName { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable, IsFilterable, IsSortable, IsFacetable]
    public string Category { get; set; }

    [IsSearchable, IsFilterable, IsFacetable]
    public string[] Tags { get; set; }

    [IsFilterable, IsFacetable]
    public bool? ParkingIncluded { get; set; }

    [IsFilterable, IsFacetable]
    public bool? SmokingAllowed { get; set; }

    [IsFilterable, IsSortable, IsFacetable]
    public DateTimeOffset? LastRenovationDate { get; set; }

    [IsFilterable, IsSortable, IsFacetable]
    public int? Rating { get; set; }

    [IsFilterable, IsSortable]
    public GeographyPoint Location { get; set; }
}
```

We have carefully chosen the attributes for each property based on how we think they will be used in an application. For example, it's likely that people searching for hotels will be interested in keyword matches on the `description` field, so we enable full-text search for that field by adding the `IsSearchable` attribute to the `Description` property.

Exactly one field in your index of type `string` must be the designated as the *key* field by adding the `Key` attribute (see `HotelId` in the above example).

The index definition above uses a language analyzer for the `description_fr` field because it is intended to store French text. For more information, see [Add language analyzers to an Azure Search index](index-add-language-analyzers.md).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the name of each property in your model class corresponds to the field name in the index. If you want to map all property names to camel-case field names, mark the class with the `SerializePropertyNamesAsCamelCase` attribute. If you want to map to a different name, you can use the `JsonProperty` attribute like the `DescriptionFr` property above. The `JsonProperty` attribute takes precedence over the `SerializePropertyNamesAsCamelCase` attribute.
> 
> 

### Create the index definition

Now that we've defined a model class, we can create an index definition easily:

```csharp
var definition = new Index()
{
    Name = "hotels-csharp",
    Fields = FieldBuilder.BuildForType<Hotel>()
};
```

### Call Indexes.Create
Now that you have an initialized `Index` object, create the index by calling `Indexes.Create` on your `SearchServiceClient` object:

```csharp
serviceClient.Indexes.Create(definition);
```

For a successful request, the method will return normally. If there is a problem with the request such as an invalid parameter, the method will throw `CloudException`.

## 2 - Load documents

To import data, you need an instance of the `SearchIndexClient` class. There are several approaches for creating this class, including using the `SearchServiceClient` instance that is already created. 

As the following example illustrates, you can use the `SearchServiceClient` instance and call its `Indexes.GetClient` method. This snippet obtains a `SearchIndexClient` for the index named "hotels" from a `SearchServiceClient` named `serviceClient`.

```csharp
ISearchIndexClient indexClient = serviceClient.Indexes.GetClient("hotels");
```

`SearchIndexClient` has a `Documents` property. This property provides all the methods you need to add, modify, delete, or query documents in your index.

> [!NOTE]
> In a typical search application, querying and indexing are handled separately. While `Indexes.GetClient` is convenient because you can reuse objects like `SearchCredentials`, a more robust approach involves creating the `SearchIndexClient` directly so that you can pass in a query key instead of an admin key. This practice is consistent with the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) and helps to make your application more secure. You'll construct a `SearchIndexClient` in the next exercise. For more information about keys, see [Create and manage api-keys for an Azure Search service](search-security-api-keys.md).

### Construct IndexBatch

To import data using the .NET SDK, package up your data into an `IndexBatch` object. An `IndexBatch` encapsulates a collection of `IndexAction` objects, each of which contains a document and a property that tells Azure Search what action to perform on that document (upload, merge, delete, and mergeOrUpload). For more information about indexing actions, see [Indexing actions: upload, merge, mergeOrUpload, delete](search-what-is-data-import.md#indexing-actions).

Assuming you know which actions to perform on your documents, you are ready to construct the `IndexBatch`. The example below shows how to create a batch with a few different actions. The example uses a custom class called `Hotel` that maps to a document in the "hotels" index.

```csharp
var actions =
    new IndexAction<Hotel>[]
    {
        IndexAction.Upload(
            new Hotel()
            {
                HotelId = "1",
                BaseRate = 199.0,
                Description = "Best hotel in town",
                DescriptionFr = "Meilleur hôtel en ville",
                HotelName = "Fancy Stay",
                Category = "Luxury",
                Tags = new[] { "pool", "view", "wifi", "concierge" },
                ParkingIncluded = false,
                SmokingAllowed = false,
                LastRenovationDate = new DateTimeOffset(2010, 6, 27, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero),
                Rating = 5,
                Location = GeographyPoint.Create(47.678581, -122.131577)
            }),
        IndexAction.Upload(
            new Hotel()
            {
                HotelId = "2",
                BaseRate = 79.99,
                Description = "Cheapest hotel in town",
                DescriptionFr = "Hôtel le moins cher en ville",
                HotelName = "Roach Motel",
                Category = "Budget",
                Tags = new[] { "motel", "budget" },
                ParkingIncluded = true,
                SmokingAllowed = true,
                LastRenovationDate = new DateTimeOffset(1982, 4, 28, 0, 0, 0, TimeSpan.Zero),
                Rating = 1,
                Location = GeographyPoint.Create(49.678581, -122.131577)
            }),
        IndexAction.MergeOrUpload(
            new Hotel()
            {
                HotelId = "3",
                BaseRate = 129.99,
                Description = "Close to town hall and the river"
            }),
        IndexAction.Delete(new Hotel() { HotelId = "6" })
    };

var batch = IndexBatch.New(actions);
```

In this case, we are using `Upload`, `MergeOrUpload`, and `Delete` as our search actions, as specified by the methods called on the `IndexAction` class.

Assume that this example "hotels" index is already populated with a number of documents. Note how we did not have to specify all the possible document fields when using `MergeOrUpload` and how we only specified the document key (`HotelId`) when using `Delete`.

Up to 1000 documents can be included in a single indexing request.

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, we are applying different actions to different documents. If you wanted to perform the same actions across all documents in the batch, instead of calling `IndexBatch.New`, you could use the other static methods of `IndexBatch`. For example, you could create batches by calling `IndexBatch.Merge`, `IndexBatch.MergeOrUpload`, or `IndexBatch.Delete`. These methods take a collection of documents (objects of type `Hotel` in this example) instead of `IndexAction` objects.
> 
> 

### Call Documents.Index
Now that you have an initialized `IndexBatch` object, you can send it to the index by calling `Documents.Index` on your `SearchIndexClient` object. The following example shows how to call `Index`, as well as some extra steps you will need to perform:

```csharp
try
{
    indexClient.Documents.Index(batch);
}
catch (IndexBatchException e)
{
    // Sometimes when your Search service is under load, indexing will fail for some of the documents in
    // the batch. Depending on your application, you can take compensating actions like delaying and
    // retrying. For this simple demo, we just log the failed document keys and continue.
    Console.WriteLine(
        "Failed to index some of the documents: {0}",
        String.Join(", ", e.IndexingResults.Where(r => !r.Succeeded).Select(r => r.Key)));
}

Console.WriteLine("Waiting for documents to be indexed...\n");
Thread.Sleep(2000);
```

Note the `try`/`catch` surrounding the call to the `Index` method. The catch block handles an important error case for indexing. If your Azure Search service fails to index some of the documents in the batch, an `IndexBatchException` is thrown by `Documents.Index`. This can happen if you are indexing documents while your service is under heavy load. **We strongly recommend explicitly handling this case in your code.** You can delay and then retry indexing the documents that failed, or you can log and continue like the sample does, or you can do something else depending on your application's data consistency requirements.

Finally, the code in the example above delays for two seconds. Indexing happens asynchronously in your Azure Search service, so the sample application needs to wait a short time to ensure that the documents are available for searching. Delays like this are typically only necessary in demos, tests, and sample applications.

For more information about document processing, see ["How the .NET SDK handles documents"](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md#how-dotnet-handles-documents).

## 3 - Search an index

Create an instance of the `SearchIndexClient` class so that you can give it a query key for read-only access (as opposed to the write-access rights conferred upon the `SearchServiceClient` used in the previous lesson).

This class has several constructors. The one you want takes your search service name, index name, and a [`SearchCredentials`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.searchcredentials?view=azure-dotnet) object as parameters. `SearchCredentials` wraps your api-key.

The code below creates a new `SearchIndexClient` for the "hotels" index using values for the search service name and api-key that are stored in the application's config file (`appsettings.json` in the case of the [sample application](https://aka.ms/search-dotnet-howto)):

```csharp
private static SearchIndexClient CreateSearchIndexClient(IConfigurationRoot configuration)
{
    string searchServiceName = configuration["SearchServiceName"];
    string queryApiKey = configuration["SearchServiceQueryApiKey"];

    SearchIndexClient indexClient = new SearchIndexClient(searchServiceName, "hotels", new SearchCredentials(queryApiKey));
    return indexClient;
}
```

`SearchIndexClient` has a [`Documents`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.search.searchindexclient.documents?view=azure-dotnet) property. This property provides all the methods you need to query Azure Search indexes.

## Construct SearchParameters
Searching with the .NET SDK is as simple as calling the `Documents.Search` method on your `SearchIndexClient`. This method takes a few parameters, including the search text, along with a `SearchParameters` object that can be used to further refine the query.

### Types of Queries
The two main [query types](search-query-overview.md#types-of-queries) you will use are `search` and `filter`. A `search` query searches for one or more terms in all *searchable* fields in your index. A `filter` query evaluates a boolean expression over all *filterable* fields in an index. You can use searches and filters together or separately.

Both searches and filters are performed using the `Documents.Search` method. A search query can be passed in the `searchText` parameter, while a filter expression can be passed in the `Filter` property of the `SearchParameters` class. To filter without searching, just pass `"*"` for the `searchText` parameter. To search without filtering, just leave the `Filter` property unset, or do not pass in a `SearchParameters` instance at all.

### Example Queries
The following sample code shows a few different ways to query the "hotels" index defined in [Create an Azure Search index in C#](search-create-index-dotnet.md#DefineIndex). The documents returned with the search results are instances of the `Hotel` class, which was defined in [Import data to an Azure Search index in C#](search-import-data-dotnet.md#construct-indexbatch). The sample code makes use of a `WriteDocuments` method to output the search results to the console. This method is described in the next section.

```csharp
SearchParameters parameters;
DocumentSearchResult<Hotel> results;

Console.WriteLine("Search the entire index for the term 'budget' and return only the hotelName field:\n");

parameters =
    new SearchParameters()
    {
        Select = new[] { "hotelName" }
    };

results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("budget", parameters);

WriteDocuments(results);

Console.Write("Apply a filter to the index to find hotels cheaper than $150 per night, ");
Console.WriteLine("and return the hotelId and description:\n");

parameters =
    new SearchParameters()
    {
        Filter = "baseRate lt 150",
        Select = new[] { "hotelId", "description" }
    };

results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("*", parameters);

WriteDocuments(results);

Console.Write("Search the entire index, order by a specific field (lastRenovationDate) ");
Console.Write("in descending order, take the top two results, and show only hotelName and ");
Console.WriteLine("lastRenovationDate:\n");

parameters =
    new SearchParameters()
    {
        OrderBy = new[] { "lastRenovationDate desc" },
        Select = new[] { "hotelName", "lastRenovationDate" },
        Top = 2
    };

results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("*", parameters);

WriteDocuments(results);

Console.WriteLine("Search the entire index for the term 'motel':\n");

parameters = new SearchParameters();
results = indexClient.Documents.Search<Hotel>("motel", parameters);

WriteDocuments(results);
```

## Handle search results
The `Documents.Search` method returns a `DocumentSearchResult` object that contains the results of the query. The example in the previous section used a method called `WriteDocuments` to output the search results to the console:

```csharp
private static void WriteDocuments(DocumentSearchResult<Hotel> searchResults)
{
    foreach (SearchResult<Hotel> result in searchResults.Results)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(result.Document);
    }

    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

Here is what the results look like for the queries in the previous section, assuming the "hotels" index is populated with the sample data:

```
Search the entire index for the term 'budget' and return only the hotelName field:

Name: Roach Motel

Apply a filter to the index to find hotels cheaper than $150 per night, and return the hotelId and description:

ID: 2   Description: Cheapest hotel in town
ID: 3   Description: Close to town hall and the river

Search the entire index, order by a specific field (lastRenovationDate) in descending order, take the top two results, and show only hotelName and lastRenovationDate:

Name: Fancy Stay        Last renovated on: 6/27/2010 12:00:00 AM +00:00
Name: Roach Motel       Last renovated on: 4/28/1982 12:00:00 AM +00:00

Search the entire index for the term 'motel':

ID: 2   Base rate: 79.99        Description: Cheapest hotel in town     Description (French): Hôtel le moins cher en ville      Name: Roach Motel       Category: Budget        Tags: [motel, budget]   Parking included: yes   Smoking allowed: yes    Last renovated on: 4/28/1982 12:00:00 AM +00:00 Rating: 1/5     Location: Latitude 49.678581, longitude -122.131577
```

The sample code above uses the console to output search results. You will likewise need to display search results in your own application. For an example of how to render search results in an ASP.NET MVC-based web application, see the [DotNetSample project](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/search-dotnet-getting-started/tree/master/DotNetSample) on GitHub.


## Build the app

1. Press F5 to build the solution and run the console app. The remaining steps in this exercise and those steps that follow are an exploration of how this code works. 

Alternatively, you can refer to [How to use Azure Search from a .NET Application](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md) for more detailed coverage of the SDK behaviors. 

## Clean up

When you're done with an index and want to delete it, call the `Indexes.Delete` method on your `SearchServiceClient`. For example:

```csharp
serviceClient.Indexes.Delete("hotels");
```


## Next steps
In this quickstart, you created an empty Azure Search index based on a schema that defines field data types and behaviors. The index is a "bare bones" index consisting of a name and a collection of attributed fields. A more realistic index would include other elements, such as [scoring profiles](index-add-scoring-profiles.md), [suggesters](index-add-suggesters.md) for typeahead  support, [synonyms](search-synonyms.md), and possibly [custom analyzers](index-add-custom-analyzers.md). We recommend that you revisit these capabilities after you understand the basic workflow.

The next quickstart in this series covers how to load the index with searchable content.
