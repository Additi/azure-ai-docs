# Create and manage alerts in Azure Cognitive Search

This article shows you how to set up alerts so that you can respond to problems as they emerge. Alerts are part of the Azure Monitor infrastructure. In Azure Cognitive Search, you can set up alerts for these conditions:

+ Metrics (queries per second, search latency, throttled requests)

+ Administrative service operations (provision or deprovision services, manage keys)
