# How to deploy large language models with Azure AI Studio 

Deployment of a large language model (LLM) makes it available for use in a website, an application, or other production environment. Deployment typically involves hosting the model on a server or in the cloud and creating an API or other interface for users to interact with the model. You can invoke the deployment for real-time inference of generative AI applications such as chat and copilot.

## Deploy open models

Use the following steps to deploy an open model such as `distilbert-base-cased` to a real-time endpoint in Azure AI Studio.

1. Choose a model you want to deploy from the Azure AI Studio [model catalog](../how-to/model-catalog.md). Alternatively, you can initiate deployment by selecting **+ Create** from `your project`>`deployments` 

1. Select **Deploy** to project on the model card details page. 

1. Choose the project you want to deploy the model to. 

1. Select **Deploy**. 

1. You land on the deployment details page. Select **Consume** to obtain code samples that can be used to consume the deployed model in your application. 

## Delete the deployment endpoint

Deleting deployments and its associated endpoint isn't supported via the Azure AI SDK. To delete deployments in Azure AI Studio, select the **Delete** button on the top panel of the deployment details page.

## Quota considerations

Deploying and inferencing with real-time endpoints can be done by consuming Virtual Machine (VM) core quota that is assigned to your subscription a per-region basis. When you sign up for Azure AI Studio, you receive a default VM quota for several VM families available in the region. You can continue to create deployments until you reach your quota limit. Once that happens, you can request for quota increase.
