# How to deploy TimeGEN-1 model with Azure AI Studio

In this article, you learn how to use Azure AI Studio to deploy the TimeGEN-1 model as a service with pay-as you go billing.
You can browse the TimeGEN-1 model in the [Model Catalog](model-catalog.md) by filtering on the Nixtla collection.

## TimeGEN-1 
Nixtlaâ€™s TimeGEN-1 is a generative pre-trained forecasting and anomaly detection model for time series data. TimeGEN-1 can produce accurate forecasts for new time series without training using only historical values and exogenous covariates as inputs.

## Deploy TimeGEN-1 with pay-as-you-go

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go, providing a way to consume them as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance organizations need. This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

TimeGEN-1 can be deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go, and is offered by Nixtla through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. Mistral AI can change or update the terms of use and pricing of this model.

### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with a valid payment method. Free or trial Azure subscriptions won't work. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [paid Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/pay-as-you-go) to begin.
- An [AI Studio hub](../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The pay-as-you-go model deployment offering for TimeGEN1 is only available with hubs created in **East US 2** region.

- An [AI Studio project](../how-to/create-projects.md).
- Azure role-based access controls (Azure RBAC) are used to grant access to operations in Azure AI Studio. To perform the steps in this article, your user account must be assigned the __Azure AI Developer role__ on the resource group.

    For more information on permissions, see [Role-based access control in Azure AI Studio](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).


### Create a new deployment

To create a deployment:

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).
1. Select **Model catalog** from the **Explore** tab and search for *TimeGEN-1*. 

    Alternatively, you can initiate a deployment by starting from your project in AI Studio. From the **Build** tab of your project, select **Deployments** > **+ Create**.

1. In the model catalog, on the model's **Details** page, select **Deploy** and then **Pay-as-you-go**.
1. Select the project in which you want to deploy your model. To deploy the TimeGEN-1 model your project must be in the **East US 2** region.
1. In the deployment wizard, select the link to **Azure Marketplace Terms** to learn more about the terms of use.
1. You can also select the **Marketplace offer details** tab to learn about pricing for the selected model.
1. If this is your first time deploying the model in the project, you have to subscribe your project for the particular offering. This step requires that your account has the **Azure AI Developer role** permissions on the Resource Group, as listed in the prerequisites. Each project has its own subscription to the particular Azure Marketplace offering of the model, which allows you to control and monitor spending. Select **Subscribe and Deploy**. Currently you can have only one deployment for each model within a project.
1. Once you subscribe the project for the particular Azure Marketplace offering, subsequent deployments of the _same_ offering in the _same_ project don't require subscribing again. If this scenario applies to you, you'll see a **Continue to deploy** option to select (Currently you can have only one deployment for each model within a project).

1. Give the deployment a name. This name becomes part of the deployment API URL. This URL must be unique in each Azure region.

1. Select **Deploy**. Wait until the deployment is ready and you're redirected to the Deployments page.
1. You can return to the Deployments page, select the deployment, and note the endpoint's **Target** URL and the Secret **Key**.
1. You can always find the endpoint's details, URL, and access keys by navigating to the **Build** tab  and selecting **Deployments** from the Components section.

To learn about billing for the TimeGEN-1 deployed with pay-as-you-go, see [Cost and quota considerations for TimeGEN-1 deployed as a service](#cost-and-quota-considerations-for-timegen1-deployed-as-a-service).

### Consume the TimeGEN-1 model as a service

TimeGEN-1 can be consumed using the chat API.

1. On the **Build** page, select **Deployments**.

1. Find and select the deployment you created.

1. Copy the **Target** URL and the **Key** value.

1.Try the samples here: <To do add the sample table>

    For more information on using the APIs, see the [reference](#reference-for-timegen1-deployed-as-a-service) section.

### Reference for TimeGEN-1 deployed as a service

#### Request schema

Payload is a JSON formatted string containing the following parameters:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `df`    | `DataFrame`  | No default. This value must be specified.  | - Description: The DataFrame on which the function will operate. Expected to contain at least the following columns:
- `time_col`: Column name in `df` that contains the time indices of the time series. This is typically a datetime column with regular intervals, e.g., hourly, daily, monthly data points.
- `target_col`: Column name in `df` that contains the target variable of the time series, i.e., the variable we wish to predict or analyze.
Additionally, you can pass multiple time series (stacked in the dataframe) considering an additional column:
- `id_col`: Column name in `df` that identifies unique time series. Each unique value in this column corresponds to a unique time series.
 |
| `stream`      | `boolean` | `False` | Streaming allows the generated tokens to be sent as data-only server-sent events whenever they become available.  |
| `max_tokens`  | `integer` | `8192`    | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length. |
| `top_p`       | `float`   | `1`     | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering `top_p` or `temperature`, but not both.  |
| `temperature` | `float`   | `1`     | The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values mean the model samples more broadly the distribution of tokens. Zero means greedy sampling. We recommend altering this or `top_p`, but not both.  |
| `ignore_eos`          | `boolean` | `False`  | Whether to ignore the EOS token and continue generating tokens after the EOS token is generated. |
| `safe_prompt` | `boolean` | `False`  | Whether to inject a safety prompt before all conversations. |

The `messages` object has the following fields:

| Key       | Type      | Value |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| `content` | `string` | The contents of the message. Content is required for all messages. |
| `role`    | `string` | The role of the message's author. One of `system`, `user`, or `assistant`. |


#### Example

__Body__

```json
{
    "messages":
    [
        { 
        "role": "system", 
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to Italian."
        },
        {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Translate the following sentence from English to Italian: I love programming."
        }
    ],
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 512,
}
```

#### Response schema

The response payload is a dictionary with the following fields:

| Key       | Type      | Description                                                                |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`      | `string`  | A unique identifier for the completion.                                    |
| `choices` | `array`   | The list of completion choices the model generated for the input messages. |
| `created` | `integer` | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) of when the completion was created.        |
| `model`   | `string`  | The model_id used for completion.                                          |
| `object`  | `string`  | The object type, which is always `chat.completion`.                        |
| `usage`   | `object`  | Usage statistics for the completion request.                               |

> [!TIP]
> In the streaming mode, for each chunk of response, `finish_reason` is always `null`, except from the last one which is terminated by a payload `[DONE]`. In each `choices` object, the key for `messages` is changed by `delta`.


The `choices` object is a dictionary with the following fields:

| Key     | Type      | Description  |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| `index` | `integer` | Choice index. When `best_of` > 1, the index in this array might not be in order and might not be `0` to `n-1`. |
| `messages` or `delta`   | `string`  | Chat completion result in `messages` object. When streaming mode is used, `delta` key is used.  |
| `finish_reason` | `string` | The reason the model stopped generating tokens: <br>- `stop`: model hit a natural stop point or a provided stop sequence. <br>- `length`: if max number of tokens have been reached. <br>- `content_filter`: When RAI moderates and CMP forces moderation <br>- `content_filter_error`: an error during moderation and wasn't able to make decision on the response <br>- `null`: API response still in progress or incomplete.|
| `logprobs` | `object` | The log probabilities of the generated tokens in the output text. |


The `usage` object is a dictionary with the following fields:

| Key                 | Type      | Value                                         |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `prompt_tokens`     | `integer` | Number of tokens in the prompt.               |
| `completion_tokens` | `integer` | Number of tokens generated in the completion. |
| `total_tokens`      | `integer` | Total tokens.                                 |

The `logprobs` object is a dictionary with the following fields:

| Key              | Type                    | Value   |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------|
| `text_offsets`   | `array` of `integers`   | The position or index of each token in the completion output. |
| `token_logprobs` | `array` of `float`      | Selected `logprobs` from dictionary in `top_logprobs` array.   |
| `tokens`         | `array` of `string`     | Selected tokens.   |
| `top_logprobs`   | `array` of `dictionary` | Array of dictionary. In each dictionary, the key is the token and the value is the probability. |

## Cost and quotas

### Cost and quota considerations for TimeGEN-1 deployed as a service

Mistral models deployed as a service are offered by Mistral AI through the Azure Marketplace and integrated with Azure AI Studio for use. You can find the Azure Marketplace pricing when deploying the model.

Each time a project subscribes to a given offer from the Azure Marketplace, a new resource is created to track the costs associated with its consumption. The same resource is used to track costs associated with inference; however, multiple meters are available to track each scenario independently.

For more information on how to track costs, see [monitor costs for models offered throughout the Azure Marketplace](./costs-plan-manage.md#monitor-costs-for-models-offered-through-the-azure-marketplace).

Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits aren't sufficient for your scenarios. 

## Content filtering

Models deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go are protected by [Azure AI Content Safety](../../ai-services/content-safety/overview.md). With Azure AI content safety, both the prompt and completion pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Learn more about [content filtering here](../concepts/content-filtering.md).
