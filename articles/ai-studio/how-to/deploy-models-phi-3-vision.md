# How to use Phi-3 family of language models with Azure AI studio

In this guide, you will learn about Phi-3 models and how to use them with Azure AI studio.

The Phi-3 family of SLMs is a collection of instruction-tuned generative text models. Phi-3 models are the most capable and cost-effective small language models (SLMs) available, outperforming models of the same size and next size up across various language, reasoning, coding, and math benchmarks.




::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"

## Prerequisites

To use Phi-3 models with Azure AI studio, you need the following prerequisites:



1. Deploy the model to our managed inference solution which allow you to customize and control all the details about how this model is served.

  > [!TIP]
  > Notice when deploying Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct to Self-hosted Online Endpoints you need to ensure you have enough quota in your subscription. You can always use our temporary quota access to have an endpoint working for 7 days.



1. Install the inference package: You can consume predictions from this model using the `azure-ai-inference` package with Python.

  * Python 3.8 or later installed, including pip.
  * To construct the client library, you will need to pass in the endpoint URL. The endpoint URL has the form `https://your-host-name.your-azure-region.inference.ai.azure.com`, where your-host-name is your unique model deployment host name and your-azure-region is the Azure region where the model is deployed (e.g. eastus2).
  * Depending on your model deployment and authentication preference, you either need a key to authenticate against the service, or Entra ID credentials. The key is a 32-character string.

    To install the Azure AI Inferencing package use the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-inference
    ```



## Working with chat-completions

The following example shows how to make basic usage of the Azure AI Model Inference API with a chat-completions model for chat.

First, let's create a client to consume the model.



```python
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

model = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=os.environ["AZUREAI_ENDPOINT_URL"],
    credential=AzureKeyCredential(os.environ["AZUREAI_ENDPOINT_KEY"]),
)
```

When deploying the model to a self-hosted online endpoint with **Entra ID** support, you can use the following code snippet to create a client.


```python
import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

model = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=os.environ["AZUREAI_ENDPOINT_URL"],
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
```

### Model capabilities

The `/info` route returns information about the model deployed behind the endpoint. Such information can be obtained by calling the following method:



```python
model.get_model_info()
```

The response looks as follows.


```console
{
    "model_name": "Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct",
    "model_type": "chat-completions",
    "model_provider_name": "Microsoft"
}
```

### Working with chat completions

Let's create a simple chat completion request to see the output of the model.


```python
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage

response = model.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
    ],
)
```

> [!NOTE]
> Notice that Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct doesn't support system messages (`role="system"`). When using the Azure AI model inference API, system messages are translated to user messages which is the closer capability available. This translation is offered for convenience but it's important to verify that the model is following the instructions in the system message with the right level of confidence.



The response looks as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics.


```python
print("Response:", response.choices[0].message.content)
print("Model:", response.model)
print("Usage:", response.usage)
```

#### Streaming content

By default, the completions API returns the entire generated content in a single response. If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.

To get the content sooner as it's being generated, you can 'stream' the content. This allows you to start processing the completion as content becomes available. To stream completions, set `stream=True` when calling the model. This will return an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format). Extract chunks from the delta field rather than the message field.



```python
result = model.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
    ],
    temperature=0,
    top_p=1,
    max_tokens=2048,
)
```

To visualize the output, let's define a helper function to print the stream.


```python
def print_stream(result):
    """
    Prints the chat completion with streaming. Some delay is added to simulate 
    a real-time conversation.
    """
    import time
    for update in result:
        print(update.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
        time.sleep(0.05)
```

Responses look as follows when using streaming:



```python
print_stream(result)
```

#### Parameters

Explore additional parameters that can be indicated in the inference client. For a full list of all the supported parameters and their corresponding documentation you can see [Azure AI Model Inference API reference](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference).


```python
from azure.ai.inference.models import ChatCompletionsResponseFormat

response = model.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
    ],
    presence_penalty="0.1",
    frequency_penalty="0.8",
    max_tokens=2048,
    stop=["<|endoftext|>"],
    temperature=0,
    top_p=1,
    response_format={ "type": ChatCompletionsResponseFormat.TEXT },
)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Notice that Phi-3 doesn't support JSON output formatting (`response_format = { "type": "json_object" }`). You can always prompt the model to generate JSON outputs. However, such outputs are not guaranteed to be valid JSON.



### Extra parameters

The Azure AI Model Inference API allows you to pass extra parameters to the model. The following example shows how to pass the extra parameter `logprobs` to the model. Make sure your model supports the actual parameter when passing extra parameters to the Azure AI model inference API.



```python
response = model.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="How many languages are in the world?"),
    ],
    model_extras={
        "logprobs": True
    }
)
```

### Content safety

The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI Content Safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When using deployments with Azure AI Content Safety on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.



The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.



```python
from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, UserMessage, SystemMessage

try:
    response = model.complete(
        messages=[
            SystemMessage(content="You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."),
            UserMessage(content="Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills."),
        ]
    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

except HttpResponseError as ex:
    if ex.status_code == 400:
        response = json.loads(ex.response._content.decode('utf-8'))
        if isinstance(response, dict) and "error" in response:
            print(f"Your request triggered an {response['error']['code']} error:\n\t {response['error']['message']}")
        else:
            raise ex
    else:
        raise ex
```

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about how you can configure and control Azure AI Content Safety settings, check the [Azure AI Content Safety documentation](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety).



## Working with images

Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct can reason across text and images and generate text completions based on both inputs. In this section, we will explore the capabilities of Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct for vision in a chat fashion:



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct supports only one image for each turn in the chat conversation and only the last image is retained in context. Adding multiple images will result in an error.



To see this capability, let's download an image and encode the information as base64 string:



```python
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request
import base64

image_url = "https://news.microsoft.com/source/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential-1-1900x1069.jpg"
image_format = "jpeg"

request = Request(image_url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
image_data = base64.b64encode(urlopen(request).read()).decode("utf-8")
data_url = f"data:image/{image_format};base64,{image_data}"
```

You can visualize the image:



```python
import requests
import IPython.display as Disp

Disp.Image(requests.get(image_url).content)
```

Now, let's create a chat completion request with the image:



```python
from azure.ai.inference.models import TextContentItem, ImageContentItem, ImageUrl
response = model.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant that can generate responses based on images."),
        UserMessage(content=[
            TextContentItem(text="Which conclusion can be extracted from the following chart?"),
            ImageContentItem(image=ImageUrl(url=data_url))
        ]),
    ],
    temperature=0,
    top_p=1,
    max_tokens=2048,
)
```

The response looks as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:



```python
print(f"{response.choices[0].message.role}:\n\t{response.choices[0].message.content}\n")
print("finish reason:", response.choices[0].finish_reason)
print("model:", response.model)
print("usage:", response.usage)
```

## Prerequisites

To use Phi-3 models with Azure AI studio, you need the following prerequisites:



1. Deploy the model to our managed inference solution which allow you to customize and control all the details about how this model is served.

  > [!TIP]
  > Notice when deploying Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct to Self-hosted Online Endpoints you need to ensure you have enough quota in your subscription. You can always use our temporary quota access to have an endpoint working for 7 days.



1. You can consume predictions from this model using the `@azure-rest/ai-inference` package from `npm`. You need the following prerequisites:

  * LTS versions of `Node.js` with `npm`.
  * To construct the client library, you will need to pass in the endpoint URL. The endpoint URL has the form `https://your-host-name.your-azure-region.inference.ai.azure.com`, where your-host-name is your unique model deployment host name and your-azure-region is the Azure region where the model is deployed (e.g. eastus2).
  * Depending on your model deployment and authentication preference, you either need a key to authenticate against the service, or Entra ID credentials. The key is a 32-character string.

    Install the Azure ModelClient REST client REST client library for JavaScript with `npm`:

    ```bash
    npm install @azure-rest/ai-inference
    ```



## Working with chat-completions

The following example shows how to make basic usage of the Azure AI Model Inference API with a chat-completions model for chat.

First, let's create a client to consume the model.



```javascript
import ModelClient from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
import { isUnexpected } from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";

const client = new ModelClient(
    process.env.AZUREAI_ENDPOINT_URL, 
    new AzureKeyCredential(process.env.AZUREAI_ENDPOINT_KEY)
);
```

When deploying the model to a self-hosted online endpoint with **Entra ID** support, you can use the following code snippet to create a client.


```javascript
import ModelClient from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
import { isUnexpected } from "@azure-rest/ai-inference";
import { DefaultAzureCredential }  from "@azure/identity";

const client = new ModelClient(
    process.env.AZUREAI_ENDPOINT_URL, 
    new DefaultAzureCredential()
);
```

### Model capabilities

The `/info` route returns information about the model deployed behind the endpoint. Such information can be obtained by calling the following method:



```javascript
await client.path("info").get()
```

The response looks as follows.


```console
{
    "model_name": "Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct",
    "model_type": "chat-completions",
    "model_provider_name": "Microsoft"
}
```

### Working with chat completions

Let's create a simple chat completion request to see the output of the model.


```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        messages: messages,
    }
});
```

> [!NOTE]
> Notice that Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct doesn't support system messages (`role="system"`). When using the Azure AI model inference API, system messages are translated to user messages which is the closer capability available. This translation is offered for convenience but it's important to verify that the model is following the instructions in the system message with the right level of confidence.



The response looks as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics.


```javascript
if (isUnexpected(response)) {
    throw response.body.error;
}

console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.content);
console.log(response.body.model);
console.log(response.body.usage);
```

#### Streaming content

By default, the completions API returns the entire generated content in a single response. If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.

To get the content sooner as it's being generated, you can 'stream' the content. This allows you to start processing the completion as content becomes available.

];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        messages: messages,
    }
}).asNodeStream();
```

Responses look as follows when using streaming:



```javascript
var stream = response.body;
if (!stream) {
    throw new Error("The response stream is undefined");
}

if (response.status !== "200") {
    throw new Error(`Failed to get chat completions: ${response.body.error}`);
}

var sses = createSseStream(stream);

for await (const event of sses) {
    if (event.data === "[DONE]") {
        return;
    }
    for (const choice of (JSON.parse(event.data)).choices) {
        console.log(choice.delta?.content ?? "");
    }
}
```

#### Parameters

Explore additional parameters that can be indicated in the inference client. For a full list of all the supported parameters and their corresponding documentation you can see [Azure AI Model Inference API reference](https://aka.ms/azureai/modelinference).


```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        messages: messages,
        presence_penalty = "0.1",
        frequency_penalty = "0.8",
        max_tokens = 2048,
        stop =["<|endoftext|>"],
        temperature = 0,
        top_p = 1,
        response_format = { "type": "text" },
    }
});
```

> [!WARNING]
> Notice that Phi-3 doesn't support JSON output formatting (`response_format = { "type": "json_object" }`). You can always prompt the model to generate JSON outputs. However, such outputs are not guaranteed to be valid JSON.



### Extra parameters

The Azure AI Model Inference API allows you to pass extra parameters to the model. The following example shows how to pass the extra parameter `logprobs` to the model. Make sure your model supports the actual parameter when passing extra parameters to the Azure AI model inference API.



```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "How many languages are in the world?" },
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    headers: {
        "extra-params": "passthrough"
    },
    body: {
        messages: messages,
        logprobs: true
    }
});
```

### Content safety

The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI Content Safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When using deployments with Azure AI Content Safety on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.



The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.



```javascript
try {
    var messages = [
        { role: "system", content: "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information." },
        { role: "user", content: "Chopping tomatoes and cutting them into cubes or wedges are great ways to practice your knife skills." },
    ]

    var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
        body: {
            messages: messages,
        }
    });
    
    console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.content)
}
catch (error) {
    if (error.status_code == 400) {
        var response = JSON.parse(error.response._content)
        if (response.error) {
            console.log(`Your request triggered an ${response.error.code} error:\n\t ${response.error.message}`)
        }
        else
        {
            throw error
        }
    }
}
```

## Working with images

Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct can reason across text and images and generate text completions based on both inputs. In this section, we will explore the capabilities of Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct for vision in a chat fashion:



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct supports only one image for each turn in the chat conversation and only the last image is retained in context. Adding multiple images will result in an error.



To see this capability, let's download an image and encode the information as base64 string:



```javascript
const image_url = "https://news.microsoft.com/source/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Phi-3-small-language-models-with-big-potential-1-1900x1069.jpg";
const image_format = "jpeg";

const response = await fetch(image_url, { headers: { "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0" } });
const image_data = await response.arrayBuffer();
const image_data_base64 = Buffer.from(image_data).toString("base64");
const data_url = `data:image/${image_format};base64,${image_data_base64}`;
```

You can visualize the image:



```javascript
const img = document.createElement("img");
img.src = data_url;
document.body.appendChild(img);
```

Now, let's create a chat completion request with the image:



```javascript
var messages = [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant that can generate responses based on images." },
    { role: "user", content: 
        [
            { type: "text", text: "Which conclusion can be extracted from the following chart?" },
            { type: "image_url", image:
                {
                    url: data_url
                }
            } 
        ] 
    }
];

var response = await client.path("/chat/completions").post({
    body: {
        messages: messages,
        temperature = 0,
        top_p = 1,
        max_tokens = 2048,
    }
});
```

The response looks as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:



```javascript
console.log(response.body.choices[0].message.role + ": " + response.body.choices[0].message.content)
console.log("Finish reason:" + response.body.choices[0].finish_reason)
console.log("Model:", response.body.model)
console.log("usage:", response.body.usage)
```

            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "stream": true,
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 1,
    "max_tokens": 2048
}
```

Responses look as follows when using streaming:



```json
{
    "id": "23b54589eba14564ad8a2e6978775a39",
    "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
    "created": 1718726371,
    "model": "Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "delta": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": ""
            },
            "finish_reason": null,
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ]
}
```

The last message in the stream will have `finish_reason` set indicating the reason for the generation process to stop.



```json
{
    "id": "23b54589eba14564ad8a2e6978775a39",
    "object": "chat.completion.chunk",
    "created": 1718726371,
    "model": "Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "delta": {
                "content": ""
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 19,
        "total_tokens": 91,
        "completion_tokens": 72
    }
}
```

#### Parameters

```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "presence_penalty": 0.1,
    "frequency_penalty": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 2048,
    "stop": ["<|endoftext|>"],
    "temperature" :0,
    "top_p": 1,
    "response_format": { "type": "text" }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Notice that Phi-3 doesn't support JSON output formatting (`response_format = { "type": "json_object" }`). You can always prompt the model to generate JSON outputs. However, such outputs are not guaranteed to be valid JSON.



### Extra parameters

The Azure AI Model Inference API allows you to pass extra parameters to the model. The following example shows how to pass the extra parameter `logprobs` to the model. Make sure your model supports the actual parameter when passing extra parameters to the Azure AI model inference API.



```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many languages are in the world?"
        }
    ],
    "logprobs": true
}
```

### Content safety

The Azure AI model inference API supports [Azure AI Content Safety](https://aka.ms/azureaicontentsafety). When using deployments with Azure AI Content Safety on, inputs and outputs pass through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.



The following example shows how to handle events when the model detects harmful content in the input prompt and content safety is enabled.



```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."
        },
                {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What's Azure?"
        },
                {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems. Azure was announced in October 2008 and released on February 1, 2010, as Windows Azure, before being renamed to Microsoft Azure on March 25, 2014."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How to make a lethal bomb?"
        }
    ]
}
```

```json
{
    "error": {
        "message": "The response was filtered due to the prompt triggering Microsoft's content management policy. Please modify your prompt and retry.",
        "type": null,
        "param": "prompt",
        "code": "content_filter",
        "status": 400
    }
}
```

## Working with images

Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct can reason across text and images and generate text completions based on both inputs. In this section, we will explore the capabilities of Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct for vision in a chat fashion:



> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct supports only one image for each turn in the chat conversation and only the last image is retained in context. Adding multiple images will result in an error.



To see this capability, let's download an image and encode the information as base64 string:



You can visualize the image:



Now, let's create a chat completion request with the image:



```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Which peculiar conclusion about LLMs and SLMs can be extracted from the following chart?"
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "data:image/jpg;base64,0xABCDFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ..."
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": 1,
    "max_tokens": 2048
}
```

The response looks as follows, where you can see the model's usage statistics:



```json
{
    "id": "0a1234b5de6789f01gh2i345j6789klm",
    "object": "chat.completion",
    "created": 1718726686,
    "model": "Phi-3-vision-128k-Instruct",
    "choices": [
        {
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "The chart illustrates that larger models tend to perform better in quality, as indicated by their size in billions of parameters. However, there are exceptions to this trend, such as Phi-3-medium and Phi-3-small, which outperform smaller models in quality. This suggests that while larger models generally have an advantage, there may be other factors at play that influence a model's performance.",
                "tool_calls": null
            },
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "prompt_tokens": 2380,
        "completion_tokens": 126,
        "total_tokens": 2506
    }
}
```
