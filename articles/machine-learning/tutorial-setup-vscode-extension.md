# Set up Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension

Learn how to install and run scripts using the Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension.

In this tutorial, you learn the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Install the Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension
> * Sign into your Azure account from Visual Studio Code
> * Use the Azure Machine Learning extension to run a sample script

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription. If you don't have one, sign up to try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview), a lightweight, cross-platform code editor.

## Install the extension

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Select **Extensions** icon from the **Activity Bar** to open the Extensions view.
1. In the Extensions view, search for "Azure Machine Learning".
1. Select **Install**.

> [!NOTE]
> Alternatively, you can install the Azure Machine Learning extension via the Visual Studio Marketplace by [downloading the installer directly](https://aka.ms/vscodetoolsforai). 

## Sign in to your Azure Account

In order to provision resources and run workloads on Azure, you have to sign in with your Azure account credentials. To assist with account management, Azure Machine Learning automatically installs the Azure Account extension. Visit the following site to [learn more about the Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account).

1. Open the command palette and enter the "Azure: Sign In" command into the text box to start the sign in process.

## Run a script in Azure

Now that you have signed into Azure with your account credentials, it's time to run a script to test whether your local Visual Studio Code environment is set up correctly.

1. Download and unzip the [VS Code Tools for AI repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tools-for-ai/archive/master.zip) anywhere on your computer.
1. Open the *mnist-vscode-docs-sample* directory in Visual Studio Code.
1. Select the **Azure** icon in the **Activity Bar**.
1. Select the **Run Experiment** icon at the top of the Azure Machine Learning View.
1. When the command palette expands, follow the prompts.

    1. Select your Azure subscription.
    1. Select **Create a new Azure ML workspace**
    1. Select the **TensorFlow Single-Node Training** job type.
    1. Enter *train.py* as the script to train.
    1. Specify the following packages as requirements to run.

        ```text
        pip: azureml-defaults; conda: python=3.6.2, tensorflow=1.15.0
        ```

1. At this point, a configuration file similar to the one below should open in the editor window.

    ```json
    {
        "workspace": "WS12191742",
        "resourceGroup": "WS12191742-rg2",
        "location": "South Central US",
        "experiment": "WS12191742-exp2",
        "compute": {
            "name": "WS12191742-com2",
            "vmSize": "Standard_D1_v2, Cores: 1; RAM: 3.5GB;"
        },
        "runConfiguration": {
            "filename": "WS12191742-com2-rc1",
            "condaDependencies": [
                "python=3.6.2",
                "tensorflow=1.15.0"
            ],
            "pipDependencies": [
                "azureml-defaults"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

1. Select **Submit experiment** to run your experiment in Azure.
1. After a few minutes, if successful, a directory called *output* is created locally containing a trained TensorFlow model.
