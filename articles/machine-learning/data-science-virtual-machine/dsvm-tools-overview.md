# Get to know your **Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)**

The **DSVM** includes an extensive **list** of popular Data Science and Machine Learning / AI Tools and Data Platforms. These have been set-up in configurations that have rigorously tested by Data Scientists and Developers at Microsoft and numerous members of the broader Data Science community to ensure stability and general viability.

The **DSVM** also includes multiple detailed and **fully worked-out samples** with code and documentation for the users to easily try out, in the form of **Jupyter Notebooks**, on the Virtual Machine itself.

The Tools, Platforms and Utilities included in the **DSVM** have been organized into logical sections in addition to the worked out samples section:

1. **[Deep Learning & AI Frameworks](dsvm-deep-learning-ai-frameworks.md)**
2. **[ML & Data Science Tools](dsvm-ml-data-science-tools.md)**
3. **[Programming Languages](dsvm-languages.md)**
4. **[Development Tools & IDEs](dsvm-tools-development.md)**
5. **[Data Ingestion Tools](dsvm-tools-ingestion.md)**
6. **[Data Exploration & Visualization Tools](dsvm-tools-explore-and-visualize.md)**
7. **[Data Platforms](dsvm-platforms.md)**
