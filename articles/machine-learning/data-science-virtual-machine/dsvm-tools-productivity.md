# Productivity tools on the Data Science Virtual Machine

In addition to the data science and programming tools, the Windows Data Science Virtual Machines has a preinstalled version of Microsoft Office 365 ProPlus with shared activation. Tools such as Word and Excel allow you to communicate your findings while staying within the VM. 

In addition, the Windows DSVMs contain Power BI Desktop. This tool is typically used to build data visualization and dashboards. 

> [!NOTE]
> You need a Microsoft Office 365 account to access Power BI.
