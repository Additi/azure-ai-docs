# Get started with the Windows Data Science Virtual Machine

The Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is a customized VM image on Microsoftâ€™s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics. 

It is available on Windows Server and on Linux. We offer Windows edition of DSVM on Server 2016 and Server 2012. To create an instance of the desired Windows DSVM edition:

* Navigating one of the following:
  * [Windows Server 2016 based DSVM](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-ads.windows-data-science-vm)
  * [Windows Server 2012 based DSVM](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsoft-ads/standard-data-science-vm/) 
* Click the **GET IT NOW** button.
* Sign in to the VM from your remote desktop using the credentials you specified when you created the VM.
* To discover and launch the tools available, click the **Start** menu.


## Next steps

* For more information on how to run specific tools available on the Windows version, see [Provision the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine](provision-vm.md) and
* For more information on how to perform various tasks needed for your data science project on the Windows VM, see [Ten things you can do on the Data science Virtual Machine](vm-do-ten-things.md).
