# Introduction to the Geo AI Data Science VM

## Why Geo AI Data Science VM? 

Integrating geography and location information to your data brings a powerful new dimension to understanding your world. This has wide range of applications in virtually every segment whether it is commercial, Government, academic or non profit organizations. This domain referred to as Geospatial analytics provides robust tools for gathering, managing and analyzing geographic data including powerful visualization to gain deeper insights into your data. The [Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](overview.md) from Microsoft is a popular experimentation and modeling environment on Azure, that provides a host of AI, Machine Learning and data science tools - all pre-configured to help you be productive instantly. By combining the predictive capability of the DSVM, the scale of Azure Cloud and the market leading Geospatial analytics software from [ESRI](http://www.esri.com), data scientists and geo-spatial analysts now have a productive platform to obtain derive new intelligence from their data and identify new opportunities. 

## What is Geo AI Data Science VM? 
The Geo AI Data Science VM (Geo-DSVM) is a product offering arising out of the collaboration between ESRI and Microsoft. It is an extension of  [Microsoft's Data Science Virtual Machine](overview.md) (DSVM) to augment it with ESRI's market leading [ArcGIS Pro](https://www.esri.com/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) geospatial analytics software. The result is a powerful environment that provides  the most popular AI and data science tools for exploring data, training predictive analytics models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms as well as mapping, geospatial analytics, and rich visualization. It is supported on the Windows 2016 Data Science Virtual Machine.  Python and R interfaces to ArcGIS are also pre-configured on the Geo-DSVM enabling programmatic access to geospatial analytics within your AI applications. We also provide samples in the form of Jupyter notebooks to get started with building AI applications infused with geospatial intelligence.
