# How to choose algorithms for Azure Machine Learning Studio

The answer to the question "What machine learning algorithm should I use?" is always "It depends." It depends on the size, quality, and nature of the data. It depends on what you want to do with the answer. It depends on how the math of the algorithm was translated into instructions for the computer you are using. And it depends on how much time you have. Even the most experienced data scientists can't tell which algorithm will perform best before trying them.

## The Azure Machine Learning Studio Algorithm Cheat Sheet

The **Azure Machine Learning Studio Algorithm Cheat Sheet** helps you choose the right machine learning algorithm for your predictive analytics solutions from the Azure Machine Learning Studio library of algorithms.

> To download the cheat sheet, go to [Machine learning algorithm cheat sheet for Azure Machine Learning Studio](algorithm-cheat-sheet.md).

This cheat sheet has a very specific audience in mind: a beginning data scientist with undergraduate-level machine learning, trying to choose an algorithm to start with in Machine Learning Studio. That means that it makes some generalizations and oversimplifications, but it points you in a safe direction. It also means that there are lots of algorithms not listed here. These are the algorithms that you can find today in Machine Learning Studio.

These recommendations are compiled feedback and tips from many data scientists and machine learning experts. We didn't agree on everything, but I've tried to harmonize our opinions into a rough consensus. Most of the statements of disagreement begin with "It depends…"

## How to use the cheat sheet

To make the best use of the algorithm cheat sheet, see [How to choose machine learning algorithms](../service/algorithm-choice.md). This article provides an in-depth look at the algorithms identified in the cheat sheet.
