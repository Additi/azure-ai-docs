# PowerShell modules for Azure Machine Learning Studio
PowerShell modules for Azure Machine Learning Studio are powerful tools that allow you to programmatically manage workspaces, datasets, web services, and more.

Three PowerShell modules currently support Studio:

* [AzureRM](#rm) released in 2015
* [PowerShell Classic](#classic) introduced in 2016
* [Azure PowerShell Az](#az) released in 2018

Although these modules have some similarities, each is designed for particular scenarios. This article describes the differences between the PowerShell modules, and helps you decide which ones to choose.

## <a name="az"></a> Azure PowerShell Az
Azure PowerShell Az is now the intended PowerShell module for interacting with Azure and includes all the functionality of AzureRM. Az offers shorter commands, improved stability, and cross-platform support.

While there is an upgrade path from AzureRM, if you encounter problems with Az PowerShell when working with Studio, report the problem and fall back to using AzureRM.

Like AzureRM, Az is based on the **Azure Resource Manager** deployment model. To learn more about the differences between AzureRM and Az, see the [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) article.

To get started with Az, follow the [installation instructions for Azure Az](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps).

## <a name="rm"></a> AzureRM

AzureRM, previously known as PowerShell Module (New), is used to manage Studio workspaces and Studio New web services. AzureRM manages solutions deployed using the **Azure Resource Manager** deployment model. To manage resources deployed using the classic deployment model, you should use the PowerShell Classic module. If you would like to learn more about the deployment models, see the [Azure Resource Manager vs. classic deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model) article.

To get started with AzureRM, follow the installation instructions in [Install Azure Powershell.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/azurerm/install-azurerm-ps)

## <a name="classic"></a> PowerShell Classic
The Studio [PowerShell Classic module](https://aka.ms/amlps) allows you to manage resources deployed using the **classic deployment model**. These resources include Studio user assets, Classic web services, and Classic web service endpoints.

However, Microsoft recommends that you use the Resource Manager deployment model for all new resources to simplify the deployment and management of resources. If you would like to learn more about the deployment models, see the [Azure Resource Manager vs. classic deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model) article.

To get started with PowerShell Classic, download the [release package](https://github.com/hning86/azuremlps/releases) from GitHub and follow the [instructions for installation](https://github.com/hning86/azuremlps/blob/master/README.md). The instructions explain how to unblock the downloaded/unzipped DLL and then import it into your PowerShell environment.

## <a name="choosing-modules"></a> Choosing Modules
Choosing between the available PowerShell modules depends on the type of resources you are managing.


Check the [support table](#suport-table) to see which resources are supported by each module. Since PowerShell Classic can be installed in parallel with either AzureRM or Az, you can install two modules to cover all resource types (Classic with AzureRM or Classic with Az)

However, it is not recommended to have AzureRm and Az installed at the same time. To decide between AzureRm and Az, Microsoft recommends Az for all future deployments. While AzureRM will continue to receive bug fixes, it will no longer receive new cmdlets. The Az module also has a compatibility mode to help you use existing scripts while you migrate to the new syntax. Use AzureRm only if there are special circumstances in your environment that require it.

To learn more about the differences between AzureRM and Az, see the [Introducing the new Azure PowerShell Az module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az) article.
