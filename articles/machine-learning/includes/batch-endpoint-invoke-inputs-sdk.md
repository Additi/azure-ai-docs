Run the endpoint with the `invoke` method by specifying the required inputs for your deployment as a dictionary `inputs = {}`. Using a dictionary provides a more general way to specify the inputs required for your deployment type. For a model deployment, which always requires only one data input, you can further simplify the `invoke` call by specifying the input as a value to the `input` parameter.
