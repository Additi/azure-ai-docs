Choose how to treat the imported labels:

* As pre-labeled data - choose this option to use the imported labels as pre-labeled data.  Your labeler can then review the pre-labeled data and correct any errors before submitting the labels.
* As final labels - choose this option to import the labels as final labels.  Only data that does not yet contain a label will be presented as tasks to your labelers.

Also on this page is an option to change the chunk size when importing.  Chunk size is the number of data points batched and processed together. The default value should work for most scenarios.
