# Schedule machine learning pipeline jobs (SDK preview)

[!INCLUDE [sdk v2](../../includes/machine-learning-sdk-v2.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SDK v2 is currently in public preview.
> The preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).


In this article, you'll learn how to programmatically schedule a pipeline to run on Azure using SDK v2. You can create a schedule based on elapsed time. Time-based schedules can be used to take care of routine tasks, such as retrain model or do batch predictions regularly to keep them up-to-date using the new coming. After learning how to create schedules, you'll learn how to retrieve, update and deactivate them via SDK.

## Prerequisites

* You must have an Azure subscription to use Azure Machine Learning. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) today.

* Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace if you don't have one. 

* The [Azure Machine Learning SDK v2 for Python](/python/api/overview/azure/ml/installv2).

## Use SDK v2 to schedule a pipeline job

To run a pipeline job on a recurring basis, you'll create a schedule. A `Schedule` associates a job, and a trigger. The trigger can either be `cron` that use cron expression to describes the wait between runs or `recurrence` that specify using what frequency to trigger job. In each case, you need define a pipeline job first, it can be existing pipeline jobs or pipeline job define in yaml, please refer to [Create a pipeline job](how-to-create-component-pipeline-python.md).

### Create pipeline in SDK

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-anthu-schedule-pup-main/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=create_pipeline_job)]

### Create a time-based schedule with recurrence pattern

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-schedule-pup/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=create_schedule_recurrence)]

This schedule refer existing pipeline job in workspace. Customer also can refer a pipeline job yaml in local.

The `RecurrenceTrigger` section contains following properties:

- **(Required)** `frequency` specifies he unit of time that describes how often the schedule fires. Can be `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`.
  
- **(Required)** `interval` specifies how often the schedule fires based on the frequency, which is the number of time units to wait until the schedule fires again.
  
- (Optional) `schedule` defines the recurrence pattern, containing `hours`, `minutes`, and `weekdays`. We provide `RecurrencePattern` to represent the recurrence pattern.
    - When `frequency` is `day`, pattern can specify `hours` and `minutes`.
    - When `frequency` is `week` and `month`, pattern can specify `hours`, `minutes` and `weekdays`.
    - `hours` should be an integer or a list, from 0 to 23.
    - `minutes` should be an integer or a list, from 0 to 59.
    - `weekdays` can be a string or list from `monday` to `sunday`.
    - If `schedule` is omitted, the job(s) will be triggered according to the logic of `start_time`, `frequency` and `interval`.

- (Optional) `start_time` specifies the start date and time with timezone of the schedule. `start_time: "2022-05-10T10:15:00-04:00"` means the schedule starts from 10:15:00AM on 2022-05-10 in UTC-4 timezone. If `start_time` is omitted, the first job will run instantly and the future jobs will run based on the schedule. If the start time is in the past, the first job will run at the next calculated run time.

- (Optional) `end_time` describes the end date and time with timezone. If `end_time` is omitted, the schedule will continue trigger jobs until ï¼Œmanual disable this schedule.  

- (Optional) `time_zone` specifies the time zone of the recurrence. If omitted, by default is UTC. See [appendix for timezone values](#appendix).

### Create a time-based schedule with cron expression

[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-schedule-pup/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=create_schedule_cron)]

The `CronTrigger` section defines the schedule details and contains following properties:

- **(Required)** `expression` uses standard crontab expression to express a recurring schedule. A single expression is composed of 5 space-delimited fields:

    `MINUTES HOURS DAYS MONTHS DAYS-OF-WEEK`

    - A single wildcard (`*`), which covers all values for the field. So a `*` in days means all days of a month (which varies with month and year).
    - The `expression: "15 16 * * 1"` in the sample above means the 16:15PM on every Monday.
    - The table below lists the valid values for each field:
 
        | Field          |   Range  | Comment                                                   |
        |----------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | `MINUTES`      |    0-59  | -                                                         |
        | `HOURS`        |    0-23  | -                                                         |
        | `DAYS`         |    -  |    Not supported. The value will be ignored and treat as `*`.    |
        | `MONTHS`       |    -  | Not supported. The value will be ignored and treat as `*`.        |
        | `DAYS-OF-WEEK` |    0-6   | Where zero (0) means Sunday. Names of days also accepted. |

    - See more details about [how to use crontab expression](https://github.com/atifaziz/NCrontab/wiki/Crontab-Expression).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > `DAYS` and `MONTH` are not supported for now. If you pass a value, it will be ignored and treat as `*`.

- (Optional) `start_time` specifies the start date and time with timezone of the schedule. `start_time: "2022-05-10T10:15:00-04:00"` means the schedule starts from 10:15:00AM on 2022-05-10 in UTC-4 timezone. If `start_time` is omitted, the first job will run instantly and the future jobs will run based on the schedule. If the start time is in the past, the first job will run at the next calculated run time.

- (Optional) `end_time` describes the end date and time with timezone. If `end_time` is omitted, the schedule will continue trigger jobs until manual disable this schedule.  

- (Optional) `time_zone`specifies the time zone of the expression. If omitted, by default is UTC. See [appendix for timezone values](#appendix).

### Manage schedule

#### Check schedule detail
[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-schedule-pup/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=show_schedule)]
#### List schedules in a workspace
[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-schedule-pup/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=list_schedule)]
#### Disable a schedule
[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-schedule-pup/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=disable_schedule)]
#### Enable a schedule
[!notebook-python[] (~/azureml-examples-schedule-pup/sdk/schedules/schedule.ipynb?name=create_schedule_cron)]

### Delete a schedule

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Please disable schedule first, only disabled schedule can be deleted.

### Query triggered jobs from a schedule
All the display name of jobs triggered by schedule will have the display name as <schedule_name>-YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ. For e.g. if a schedule with a name of named-schedule is created with a schedule of run every 12 hours starting 6 AM on Jan 1 2021, then the display names of the jobs created will be as follows:

- named-schedule-20210101T060000Z
- named-schedule-20210101T180000Z
- named-schedule-20210102T060000Z
- named-schedule-20210102T180000Z and so on

You can filter the job display name using schedule name to query triggered job by this schedule.
