# Tutorial: Hello Azure

The new tutorial goes here...

## Clean up resources

Do not complete this section if you plan on running other Azure Machine Learning tutorials.

### Stop the compute instance

[!INCLUDE [aml-stop-server](../../includes/aml-stop-server.md)]

### Delete everything

[!INCLUDE [aml-delete-resource-group](../../includes/aml-delete-resource-group.md)]

You can also keep the resource group but delete a single workspace. Display the workspace properties and select **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you did the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Connected your workspace and created an experiment
> * Loaded data and trained scikit-learn models
> * Viewed training results in the studio and retrieved models

[Deploy your model](tutorial-deploy-models-with-aml.md) with Azure Machine Learning.
Learn how to develop [automated machine learning](tutorial-auto-train-models.md) experiments.
