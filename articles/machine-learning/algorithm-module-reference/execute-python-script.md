# Execute Python Script

*Executes a Python script from an Azure Machine Learning experiment*

Category: Python Language Modules

## Module overview

This article describes how to use the **Execute Python Script** module in Azure Machine Learning service to run Python code. For more information about the architecture and design principles of Python, see [the following article.](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-execute-python-scripts)

With Python, you can perform tasks that aren't currently supported by existing modules such as:

+ Visualizing data using `matplotlib`
+ Using Python libraries to enumerate datasets and models in your workspace
+ Reading, loading, and manipulating data from sources not supported by the [Import Data](./import-data.md) module

Azure Machine Learning uses the Anaconda distribution of Python, which includes many common utilities for data processing. We will update Anaconda version automatically. Current version is:
 -  Anaconda 4.5+ distribution for Python 3.6 


## How to use Execute Python Script

The **Execute Python Script** module contains sample Python code that you can use as a starting point. To configure the **Execute Python Script** module, you provide a set of inputs and Python code to execute in the **Python script** text box.

1. Add the **Execute Python Script** module to your experiment.

2. Add and connect on **Dataset1** any datasets from the interface that you want to use for input. Reference this dataset in your Python script as **DataFrame1**.

    Use of a dataset is optional, if you want to generate data using Python, or use Python code to import the data directly into the module.

    This module supports addition of a second dataset on **Dataset2**. Reference the second dataset in your Python script as DataFrame2.

    Datasets stored in Azure Machine Learning are automatically converted to **pandas** data.frames when loaded with this module.

4. To include new Python packages or code, add the zipped file containing these custom resources  on **Script bundle**. The input to **Script bundle** must be a zipped file already uploaded to your workspace. 

    Any file contained in the uploaded zipped archive can be used during experiment execution. If the archive includes a directory structure, the structure is preserved, but you must prepend a directory called **src** to the path.

5. In the **Python script** text box, type or paste valid Python script.

    The **Python script** text box is pre-populated with some instructions in comments, and sample code for data access and output. **You must edit or replace this code.** Be sure to follow Python conventions about indentation and casing.

    + The script must contain a function named `azureml_main` as the entry point for this module.
    + The entry point function can contain up to two input arguments: `Param<dataframe1>` and `Param<dataframe2>`
    + Zipped files connected to the third input port are unzipped and stored in the directory, `.\Script Bundle`, which is also added to the Python `sys.path`. 

    Therefore, if your zip file contains `mymodule.py`, import it using `import mymodule`.

    + Two datasets can be returned to the interface, which must be a sequence of type `pandas.DataFrame`. You can create other outputs in your Python code and write them directly to Azure storage.

6. Run the experiment, or select the module and click **Run selected** to run just the Python script.

    All of the data and code is loaded into a virtual machine, and run using the specified Python environment.

### Results

The results of any computations performed by the embedded Python code must be provided as a pandas.DataFrame, which is automatically converted to the Azure Machine Learning dataset format, so that you can use the results with other modules in the experiment.

The module returns two datasets:  
  
+ **Results Dataset 1**, defined by the first returned pandas dataframe in Python script

+ **Result Dataset 2**, defined by the second returned pandas dataframe in Python script
