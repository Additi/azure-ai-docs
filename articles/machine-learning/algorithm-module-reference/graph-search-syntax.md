# Graph search query syntax

The graph search feature allows customer to search for a node by its name and several properties. Customer can type keywords and add filters in UI as shown in below image.

It's also possible to type a search query directly. This article explains the supported search query syntax. 

The graph search feature supports full-text keyword search on node name and comment. It also supports add filter on node property like runStatus, duration, computeTarget. The keyword search is based on lucene query. The filter recognizes a simple filter query describes below. The complete search query looks like this:  

**[lucene query | [filter query]** 

 

Customer can use only one of Lucene query or filter query. If customer wants to use both, separator **|** is required. The syntax of the filter query is more strict than Lucene query. So if customer input can be parsed as both, filter query will be applied.

 

## Lucene query


Graph search will use Lucene simple query as full-text search syntax on node "name" and "comment". Following Lucene operator is supported:

 
- AND/OR
- Wildcard matching  ? / *

 
### Examples

 

- Simple search


    JSON Data

- AND/OR

 

    JSON AND Validation

 

- Complicated AND/OR

 

    (JSON AND Validation) OR (TSV AND Training)

 

- Wildcard matching (**Please note that * cannot be the first character of lucene query**)
    - machi?e learning
    - mach*ing

 


 

##  Filter query

 
Filter query will follow below pattern.

 

**[key1] [operator1] [value1]; [key2] [operator1] [value2];**

 

Following node properties are supported as key:

- runStatus
- compute
- duration
- reuse

And following operators are supported:

- Greater or equal: `>=`
- Less or equal: `<=`
- Greater: `>`
- Less: `<`
- Equal: `==`
- Contain: `=`
- NotEqual: `!=`
- In: `in`

 
 

### Example

- duration > 100;
- status in { Failed,NotStarted}
- compute in {gpu-cluster}; runStatus in {Completed}

## Technical notes

- The relation between different filters is "AND"
- If `>= / > / < / <=` these four operators is chosen, the value will be automatically converted to number type, otherwise string is used for comparison.
- For all string type value, case is insensitive in comparison.
- Operator "In" expects a collection as value, collection syntax is `{name1, name2, name3}`
- Space will be ignored between keywords
