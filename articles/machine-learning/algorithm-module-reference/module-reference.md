# Algorithm & module reference overview

This reference content provides the technical background on each of the machine learning algorithms and modules available in Azure Machine Learning designer (preview).

Each module represents a set of code that can run independently and perform a machine learning task, given the required inputs. A module might contain a particular algorithm, or perform a task that is important in machine learning, such as missing value replacement, or statistical analysis.

> [!TIP]
> In any experiment in the designer, you can get information about a specific module. Select the module, then select the **more help** link in the **Quick Help** pane.

## Modules

Modules are organized by functionality:

| Functionality | Description | Module |
| --- |--- | ---- |
| Data input and output | Move data from cloud sources into your experiment. Write your results or intermediate data to Azure Storage, a SQL database, or Hive, while running an experiment, or use cloud storage to exchange data between experiments.  | [Import Data](import-data.md)<br/>[Export Data](export-data.md)<br/>[Enter Data Manually](enter-data-manually.md) |
| Data transformation | Operations on data that are unique to machine learning, such as normalizing or binning data, dimensionality reduction, and converting data among various file formats.| [Add Columns](add-columns.md) <br/> [Add Rows](add-rows.md) <br/> [Clean Missing Data](clean-missing-data.md) <br/> [Convert to CSV](convert-to-csv.md) <br/> [Convert to Dataset](convert-to-dataset.md) <br/> [Convert to Indicator Values](convert-to-indicator-values.md) <br/> [Edit Metadata](edit-metadata.md) <br/> [Join Data](join-data.md) <br/> [Normalize Data](normalize-data.md) <br/> [Partition and Sample](partition-and-sample.md) <br/> [Remove Duplicate Rows](remove-duplicate-rows.md) <br/> [Select Columns Transform](select-columns-transform.md) <br/> [Select Columns in Dataset](select-columns-in-dataset.md) <br/> [Split Data](split-data.md) |
