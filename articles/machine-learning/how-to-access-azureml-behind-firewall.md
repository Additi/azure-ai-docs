# Use Azure Machine Learning workspace behind Azure Firewall

This article contains information on configuring Azure Firewall for use with Azure Machine Learning.

Azure Firewall can be used to control access to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and the public internet. If not configured correctly, the firewall can cause problems using your workspace.

## Network rules

On your firewall, create a network rule allowing traffic to and from the addresses in this article.

> [!TIP]
> When adding the network rule, set the __Protocol__ to any, and the ports to `*`.
>
> For more information on configuring Azure Firewall, see [Deploy and configure Azure Firewall](../firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal.md#configure-a-network-rule).
