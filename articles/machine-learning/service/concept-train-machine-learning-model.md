# Train models with Azure Machine Learning

Azure Machine Learning provides several ways to train your models. Use the following list to determine which training method is right for you:

+ **Visual interface**: The Azure Machine Learning __visual interface__ provides a way to train models using a drag and drop web-based UI. You can use Python code as part of the design, or train models without writing any code.

+ **Python**: The Azure Machine Learning SDK provides several methods to train models:

    + **Run**: A run submits a single instance of a training script as a training job. A run is a generic way to train a model with Azure Machine Learning. Define the training environment and then submit the training script.

    + **Estimator**: Estimator classes build on the basic run process, and make it easy to train models based on popular machine learning frameworks. There are estimator classes for Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Chainer. There is also a generic estimator that can be used with frameworks that do not already have a dedicated estimator class.

    + **Automated machine learning**: Automate the time consuming, iterative tasks of model development. Azure Machine Learning uses the parameters you provide to iteratively train models until one meets your criteria.

    + **Machine learning pipeline**: Optimizes your workflow with speed, portability, and reusability. Machine learning pipelines can use runs, estimators, and automated ML as steps in a pipeline. You can create templates and publish a pipeline as a parameterized REST API, which can then be used to start or schedule runs.

    In addition to the Python SDK, you can also start training runs (including estimators, automated machine learning, and pipelines) from the Azure CLI by using the [machine learning CLI extension](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md).

Each of these training methods can use different types of compute resources for training. Collectively, these resources are referred to as [__compute targets__](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md#compute-targets). A compute target can be a local machine or a cloud resource, such as an Azure Machine Learning Compute, Azure HDInsight, or a remote virtual machine.

## Visual interface

The visual interface (preview) enables you to train models using a drag and drop interface in your web browser.

## Run

A run uses a __run configuration__ to define the environment needed to run your training script. Azure Machine Learning uses the run configuration to configure the environment on the compute target when you submit your script for a training run.

You may start with a run configuration for your local computer, and then switch to one for a cloud-based compute target as needed. When changing the compute target, you only change the run configuration you use. A run also logs information about the training job, such as the inputs, outputs, and logs.

## Estimator

Estimators make it easy to train models using popular ML frameworks.

* [How to: Create estimators in training](how-to-train-ml-models.md)

## Automated Machine Learning

Define the iterations, hyperparameter settings, featurization, and other settings. During training, Azure Machine Learning tries different algorithms and parameters in parallel. Training stops once it hits the exit criteria you defined.

## Machine learning pipeline

Machine learning pipelines optimize your workflow with the following key features:

| Feature | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Unattended runs | Schedule steps to run in parallel or in sequence in a reliable and unattended manner. Perfect for long running tasks such as data preparation or long running training jobs. |
| Heterogenous compute | Use multiple ML pipelines that are reliably coordinated across heterogeneous and scalable compute resources and storage locations. |
| Reusability | Create ML pipeline templates for specific scenarios, such as training or batch scoring. Publish the pipelines as a REST endpoint and trigger via REST calls. |
| Tracking and versioning | ML pipelines can explicitly name and version your data sources, inputs, and outputs. You can also manage scripts and data separately for increased productivity. |
| Collaboration | ML pipelines allow data scientists to collaborate across all areas of the machine learning design process, while being able to concurrently work on pipeline steps. |
