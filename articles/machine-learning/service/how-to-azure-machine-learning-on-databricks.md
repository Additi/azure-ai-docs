# Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK on Databricks

Use the Azure Machine Learning SDK for end to end custom machine learning on Azure Databricks. Or train your model within Databricks and use [Visual Studio Code](how-to-vscode-train-deploy.md#deploy-your-service-from-vs-code) to deploy the model

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLfree) before you begin.

## Prepare your Databricks cluster

1. Create a [Databricks cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-databricks/quickstart-create-databricks-workspace-portal). Create your Azure Databricks cluster as v4.x (high concurrency preferred) with **Python 3**. 
1. Create a library to [install and attach](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/libraries.html#create-a-library) the `azureml-sdk[databricks]` PyPi package to your cluster. 
    Be aware of these [common Databricks issues](resource-known-issues.md#databricks).
1. Download the [Azure Databricks Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/databricks/Databricks_AMLSDK_github.dbc) Databricks notebooks archive file.
1.  [Import the archive file](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/notebooks/notebook-manage.html#import-an-archive) into your Databricks cluster.  

 

## Try it out

The notebooks demonstrate how to prepare data, train, and deploy a Spark ML model from within Azure Databricks using the Azure ML Python SDK. 

Use the notebooks to predict income based on [census dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).  You train an income prediction model. The model  predicts whether an individual's income is >50 K or <50 K based on demographic data.

1. Prepare your environment.  Run the [Installation and Configuration](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/databricks/01.Installation_and_Configuration.ipynb) Databricks notebook to:

    * Create an Azure ML workspace
    * Save the ML workspace configuration

2. Prepare your data. Run the [Ingest data](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/databricks/02.Ingest_data.ipynb) Databricks notebookto download the Adult Census Income data and splits it into train and test sets.

3. Build  models. Run the [Build model with Run History](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/databricks/03b.Build_model_runHistory.ipynb) Databricks notebook to:

    * Prepare data using Pandas
    * Split data into train and test sets
    * Log training metrics into your machine learning workspace
    * Manually train different models with Spark Mllib
    * Find the best model from your runs

4. Deploy and predict.  Deploy your model from within Azure Databricks:  

    * Test the deployment on [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-instances/) (ACI).  Run the [Deploy to ACI](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/databricks/04.Deploy_to_ACI.ipynb) Databricks notebook to:

        * Register your best model in the machine learning workspace
        * Provide a scoring file and a conda config file
        * Deploy the model to ACI and test the webservice

    * Use the image you created on ACI to deploy to [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/kubernetes-service/) (AKS) for scalable webservice.   Run the [Deploy to AKS](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/databricks/04.Deploy_to_AKS_existingImage.ipynb) Databricks notebook to:

        * Deploy the the image created in the ACI notebook to AKS as a scalable webservice
        * Monitor the deployed webservice and model in Azure portal

>[!TIP]
> You can also train your model on Databricks and then use [Visual Studio Code](how-to-vscode-train-deploy.md#deploy-your-service-from-vs-code) to deploy the model.
