# Azure Machine Learning Hardware Acceleration package

Azure Machine Learning Hardware Acceleration package is a Python pip-installable extension for Azure Machine Learning that enables data scientists and AI developers to quickly:

+ Featurize images with a quantized version of ResNet 50

+ Train classifiers based on those features

+ Deploy models to an FPGA on Azure for ultra-low latency inferencing

## Prerequisites

1. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

1. The following accounts and application must be set up and installed:
   - Azure Machine Learning Experimentation account 
   - An Azure Machine Learning Model Management account
   - Azure Machine Learning Workbench installed

   If these three are not yet created or installed, follow the [Azure Machine Learning Quickstart and Workbench installation](../service/quickstart-installation.md) article. 

1. The package must be installed.
