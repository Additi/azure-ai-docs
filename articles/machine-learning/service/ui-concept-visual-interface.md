# What is the visual interface for Azure Machine Learning service? 

The visual interface (preview) for Azure Machine Learning service enables you to prep data, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models without writing code.

There is no programming required, you visually connect [datasets](#datasets) and [modules](#modules) to construct your model.

The visual interface uses your Azure Machine Learning service [workspace](concept-workspace.md) to:

+ Access the [compute targets](#compute-targets) to run [experiments](#experiments).
+ Write the results of experiment runs into the workspace.
+ Access [datasets](#datasets).
+ Register models and create deployments.

## Workflow

You typically use data from one or more sources to develop a predictive analysis model.  You transform and analyze the data through various data manipulation and statistical functions, then generate a set of results. This process is an iterative one. Modify the various functions and their parameters until you are satisfied that you have trained an effective model.

The visual interface gives you an interactive, visual workspace to quickly build, test, and iterate on a model. 

+ You drag-and-drop [datasets](#datasets) and analysis [modules](#modules) onto the canvas.
+ Connect the modules together to form an [experiment](#experiment).
+ Run the experiment using the compute resource of the Machine Learning Service workspace.
+ Iterate on your model design by editing the experiment and running it again.
+ When you're ready, convert your **training experiment** to a **predictive experiment**.
+ Deploy the predictive experiment as a [web service](#web-service) so that your model can be accessed by others.

## Experiment

An experiment consists of datasets that provide data to analytical modules, which you connect together to construct a model. Specifically, a valid experiment has these characteristics:

* The experiment contains at least one dataset and one module.
* Datasets may be connected only to modules.
* Modules may be connected to either datasets or other modules.
* All input ports for modules must have some connection to the data flow.
* All required parameters for each module must be set.

Create a training experiment from scratch, or use an existing sample experiment as a template.

For an example of a simple experiment, see [Quickstart: Prepare and visualize data without writing code in Azure Machine Learning](ui-quickstart-run-experiment.md).

For a more complete walkthrough of a predictive analytics solution, see [Tutorial: Predict automobile price with the visual interface](ui-tutorial-automobile-price-train-score.md).

## Compute target

A compute target is the compute resource that you use to run your experiment or host your service deployment. The supported compute targets are:


| Compute target | Training | Deployment |
| ---- |:----:|:----:|
| Azure Machine Learning compute | ✓ | |
| Azure Kubernetes Service | | ✓ |

Compute targets are attached to your Machine Learning [workspace](concept-workspace.md). You manage your compute targets in your workspace in Azure portal.

## Web service

Once your predictive analytics model is ready, you deploy it as a web service right from the visual interface.

The web services provide an interface between an application and your scoring model. An external application can communicate with the scoring model in real time. A call to a web service returns prediction results to an external application. To make a call to a web service, you pass an API key that was created when you deployed the web service. The web service is based on REST, a popular architecture choice for web programming projects.

To learn how to deploy your model, see [Tutorial: Deploy a machine learning model with the visual interface](ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy.md).

## Datasets

A dataset is data that has been uploaded to the visual interface to use in the modeling process. A number of sample datasets are included for you to experiment with, and you can upload more datasets as you need them.

## Modules

A module is an algorithm that you can perform on your data. The visual interface has a number of modules ranging from data ingress functions to training, scoring, and validation processes.

A module may have a set of parameters that you can use to configure the module's internal algorithms. When you select a module on the canvas, the module's parameters are displayed in the Properties pane to the right of the canvas. You can modify the parameters in that pane to tune your model.
