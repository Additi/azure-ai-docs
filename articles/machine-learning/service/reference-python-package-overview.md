# Python packages for Azure Machine Learning

This section contains the reference documentation for proprietary Python packages from Microsoft for Azure Machine Learning.

You can use these libraries and functions in combination with other open source or third-party packages, but to use the proprietary packages, your Python code must run against a service or on a computer that provides the interpreters.


|Library details||
|---------|---------|
|Service|Azure Machine Learning (not Studio)|
|Built on|Anaconda 4.2 distribution of Python 3.5|


## Domain-specific packages
