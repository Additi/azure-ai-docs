# Tutorial: Deploy a machine learning model with the visual interface

To give others a chance to use the predictive model developed in [part one of the tutorial](ui-tutorial-automobile-price-train-score.md), you can deploy it as an Azure web service. So far, you have trained your model. Now, it's time to generate new predictions based on user input. In this part of the tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Prepare a model for deployment
> * Deploy a web service
> * Test a web service
> * Manage a web service
> * Consume the web service

## Prerequisites

Complete [part one of the tutorial](ui-tutorial-automobile-price-train-score.md) to learn how to train and score a machine learning model in the visual interface.

## Prepare for deployment

Before you deploy your pipeline as a web service, you first have to convert your *training pipeline* into a *predictive pipeline*.

1. Select **Publish** at the top of the pipeline canvas.

1. In the Setup **Pipeline Run** dialog, select the drop-down arrow underneath **PipelineEndpoint** and select **+New PipelineEndpoint**

1. Select **Publish**

1. At the top of the pipeline canvas, select **Create inference pipeline** > **Real-time inference pipeline**

    When you select **Create Predictive Pipeline**, several things happen:
    
    * The trained model is stored as a **Trained Model** module in the module palette. You can find it under **Trained Models**.
    * Modules that were used for training are removed; specifically:
      * Train Model
      * Split Data
    * The saved trained model is added back into the pipeline.
    * **Web Service Input** and **Web Service Output** modules are added. These modules identify where the user data will enter the model, and where data is returned.

    The **training pipeline** is still saved under the new tabs at the top of the pipeline canvas, and as a pipeline draft in visual interface.

1. **Run** the pipeline using the same default compute and experiment you created in part 1.

1. Select the output of the **Score Model** module and select **View Results** to verify the model is still working. You can see the original data is displayed, along with the predicted price ("Scored Labels").

   Your pipeline should now look like this:  

   ![Screenshot showing the expected configuration of the pipeline after preparing it for deployment](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/predictive-graph.png)

1. Select **Deploy**.

## Create the inferencing cluster

In the **Set up real-time endpoint** dialog that appears, you can select from existing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters to deploy your model. If you don't already have an AKS cluster, use the follow instructions to create one now.

1. Select **Compute** in the dialog to navigate to the **Compute** page.

1. In the navigation ribbon, select **Inference Clusters** > **+ New**.

1. In the inference cluster pane, configure a new Kubernetes Service.

    Enter "aks-compute" for the **Compute name**.
    
    Select a nearby available **Region**.

    Select **Create**.

    > [!Note]
    > It takes approximately 15 minutes to create a new AKS service. You can check the provisioning state on the **Inference Clusters** page
    >

## Deploy the web service

After your AKS service has finished provisioning, return to the real-time inferencing pipeline to complete deployment.

1. Select **Deploy** above the canvas.

1. Select **Deploy new real-time endpoint**. 

1. Select the aks-compute cluster you created as your **Compute target**.

    Currently, the visual interface only supports deployment to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) compute targets. You can choose from available AKS compute targets in your machine learning service workspace or configure a new AKS environment using the steps in the dialogue that appears.

1. Select **Deploy**. You'll see a success notification above the canvas when deployment completes. Deployment may take a few minutes.

## Test the web service

You can test and manage your visual interface web services by navigating to the **Endpoints** tab.

1. Go to the web service section. You'll see the web service you deployed with the name **auto-price**.

     ![Screenshot showing the web service tab with the recently created web service highlighted](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/web-services.png)

1. Select the web service name to view additional details.

1. Select **Test**.

    [![Screenshot showing the web service testing page](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/web-service-test.png)](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/web-service-test.png#lightbox)

1. Input testing data or use the autofilled sample data and select **Test**.

    The test request is submitted to the web service and the results are shown on page. Although a price value is generated for the input data, it is not used to generate the prediction value.

## Consume the web service

Users can now send API requests to your Azure web service and receive results to predict the price of their new automobiles.

**Request/Response** - The user sends one or more rows of automobile data to the service by using an HTTP protocol. The service responds with one or more sets of results.

You can find sample REST calls in the **Consume** tab of the web service details page.

   ![Screenshot showing a sample REST call that users can find in the Consume tab](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/web-service-consume.png)

Navigate to the **API Doc** tab, to find more API details.

## Manage models and deployments

The models and web service deployments you create in the visual interface can also be managed from the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

1. Open your workspace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).  

1. In your workspace, select **Models**. Then select the pipeline you created.

    ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to pipelines in the Azure portal](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/portal-models.png)

    On this page, you'll see additional details about the model.

1. Select **Deployments**, it will list any web services that use the model. Select the web service name, it will go to web service detail page. In this page, you can get more detailed information of the web service.

    [![Screenshot detailed run report](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/deployment-details.png)](./media/ui-tutorial-automobile-price-deploy/deployment-details.png#lightbox)

You can also find these models and deployments in the **Models** and **Endpoints** sections of your [workspace landing page (preview)](https://ml.azure.com).
