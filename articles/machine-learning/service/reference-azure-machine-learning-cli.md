# What is the Azure Machine Learning CLI?

The Azure Machine Learning CLI extension enables data scientists and developers working with Azure Machine Learning service to quickly automate machine learning workflows and put them into production, such as:
+ Train machine learning models
+ Track and version models
+ Containerize and deploy models as web services

This machine learning CLI is an extension of [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) and was built on top of the [Python-based SDK for Azure Machine Learning service](reference-azure-machine-learning-sdk.md).

Use the rich set of `az ml` commands to interact the service in any command-line environment, including Azure portal cloud shell.  

Look up commands in [the CLI reference documentation]().
