# What is the Azure Machine Learning CLI?

The Azure Machine Learning CLI enables data scientists and developers working with Azure Machine Learning Services to quickly automate machine learning tasks and workflows and put them into production, such as:
+ Train machine learning models
+ Track and version models
+ Containerize and deploy models as web services

This machine learning CLI is an extension of [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest).

This CLI was build on top of the [Python-based SDK for Azure Machine Learning services](reference-azure-machine-learning-sdk.md).
