# Monitor model performance with TensorBoard and Azure Machine Learning

In this article, you learn how to export your machine learning experiment run histories as TensorBoard logs using the [Azure Machine Learning service SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py). This allows you to visualize and inspect your experiment runs and metrics, so you can tune and retrain your machine learning models.

[TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/r1/overview) is a suite of web applications for inspecting and understanding your experiment structure and performance.

With the Azure Machine Learning SDK `tensorboard` extra, you can     
* Launch TensorBoard from your current experiment's run history.

* Convert and export experiment run histories and view their performance via TensorBoard.

## Prerequisites

The code in this how-to can be run in either of the following environments: 

* Azure Machine Learning Notebook VM - no downloads or installation necessary

    * Complete the cloud-based notebook quickstart to create a dedicated notebook server pre-loaded with the SDK and the sample repository.

    * In the samples folder on the notebook server, find  two completed and expanded notebooks by navigating to this directory: **how-to-use-azureml > training-with-deep-learning**.
        * export-run-history-to-run-history.ipynb
        * tensorboard.ipynb

* Your own Juptyer notebook server
  * Use the [Create a workspace article](setup-create-workspace.md) to
      * [Install the Azure Machine Learning SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py) with the `tensorboard` extra
      * Create a workspace and its configuration file (config.json)

## Launch TensorBoard from run history

To launch TensorBoard and view your experiment run histories, your experiments need to have previously enabled logging to track its metrics and performance. You can launch TensorBoard from the run history of any experiment regardless of the framework or environment it was created. 

The following code sets up an experiment, begins the logging process using the Azure Machine Learning run history APIs, and exports the experiment logs and run history to TensorBoard for visualizing. 

### Set up experiment

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace, Experiment
import azuremml.core

ws = Workspace.from_config()
experiment_name = 'export-to-tensorboard'
exp = Experiment(ws, experiment_name)
root_run = exp.start_logging()

# load diabetes dataset, a well-known built-in small dataset that comes with scikit-learn

from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X, y = load_diabetes(return_X_y=True)
columns = ['age', 'gender', 'bmi', 'bp', 's1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 's6']
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)
data = {
    "train":{"x":x_train, "y":y_train},        
    "test":{"x":x_test, "y":y_test}
}
```
### Create experiment and start logging
```python
from tqdm import tqdm
alphas = [.1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6 , .7]
# try a bunch of alpha values in a Linear Regression (Ridge) mode
for alpha in tqdm(alphas):
  # create a bunch of child runs
  with root_run.child_run("alpha" + str(alpha)) as run
   # More data science stuff
   reg = Ridge(alpha=alpha)
   reg.fit(data["train"]["x"], data["train"]["y"])    
 
   preds = reg.predict(data["test"]["x"])
   mse = mean_squared_error(preds, data["test"]["y"])
   # End train and eval

# log alpha, mean_squared_error and feature names in run history
   root_run.log("alpha", alpha)
   root_run.log("mse", mse)
```

### Export runs to TensorBoard

In the following code, we create the folder `logdir` in our current working directory. This folder is where we will export our experiment run history and logs from `root_run` and then mark that run as completed. 

```Python
from azureml.tensorboard.export import export_to_tensorboard
import os

logdir = 'exportedTBlogs'
log_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), logdir)
try:
    os.stat(log_path)
except os.error:
    os.mkdir(log_path)
print(logdir)

# export run history for the project
export_to_tensorboard(root_run, logdir)

root_run.complete()
```

>[!Note]
 You can also export a particular run to TensorBoard by specifying the name of the run  `export_to_tensorboard(run_name, logdir)`

### Start and stop TensorBoard 
You can launch TensorBoard during your run or after it has completed. In this example, we create a TensorBoard object instance, `tb`, that takes the experiment run history in the `logdir` directory, and then launch TensorBoard with the `start()` method,  

The [TensorBoard constructor](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/azureml.tensorboard.tensorboard?view=azure-ml-py) takes an array of runs, so be sure and pass it in as a single-element array.

```python
from azureml.tensorboard import Tensorboard

tb = Tensorboard([], local_root=logdir, port=6006)

# If successful, start() returns a string with the URI of the instance.
tb.start()

# After your job completes, be sure to stop() the streaming otherwise it will continue to run. 
tb.stop()
```

## Export and convert run histories

Experiments created using deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow or Keras, output run histories that are consumable in TensorBoard. This means we don't have to go through a conversion step in order to view them with TensorBoard.

With the SDK's [export_to_tensorboard()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-tensorboard/azureml.tensorboard.export?view=azure-ml-py) method, experiments created with other frameworks like scikit learn or Azure machine learning it's possible to export those run histories and view them via TensorBoard. 

The following example takes a scikit learn model and exports the run histories into TensorBoard.
