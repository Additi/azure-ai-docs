# Quickstart: Get started with Azure Machine Learning using the CLI extension

In this quickstart, you'll use a machine learning CLI extension to get started with [Azure Machine Learning Services](overview-what-is-azure-ml.md).

Using the CLI, you'll learn how to:

1. Create a workspace, which is the top-level resource for this service. This workspace is used by one or more users to store their compute resources, models, deployments, and run histories.
1. Attach a project containing your machine learning scripts to your workspace.   A project is a local folder that contains the scripts needed to solve your machine learning problem.  
1. Run a Python script in your project to show a few metrics.
1. View the run history.

> [!NOTE]
> For your convenience, the following Azure resources are added automatically to your workspace when regionally available:  [container registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/), [storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/), [application insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-insights/), and [key vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/).

The resources you create can be used as prerequisites to other Azure Machine Learning tutorials and how-to articles.

This CLI was built on top of the [Python-based SDK for Azure Machine Learning services](reference-azure-machine-learning-sdk.md).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites before starting the quickstart steps:

+ An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
+ [Python 3.5 or higher](https://www.python.org/) installed
+ [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) installed

## Install the CLI extension

On your computer, open a command-line editor and install [the machine learning extension to Azure CLI](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md).  The installation can take several minutes to complete.

```azurecli
az extension add azureml-sdk
```

## Create a resource group

A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. Using Azure CLI, sign into Azure, specify the subscription, and create a resource group.

In a command-line window, sign in with the Azure CLI command, [`az login`](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login). Follow the prompts for interactive login:
    
   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

List the available Azure subscriptions, and specify the one you want to use:
   ```azurecli
   az account list --output table
   az account set --subscription <your-subscription-id>
   az account show
   ```
   where \<your-subscription-id\> is ID value for the subscription you want to use that was output by az account list. Do not include the brackets.

Create a resource group to hold your workspace.
   In this quickstart:
   + The name of the resource group is `myrg`.
   + The region is `eastus2`. You can use any [available region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/) close to your data.  

   ```azurecli
   az group create -n my_resource_group -l eastus2
   ```

## Create a workspace and attach a project

In the command-line window, create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace under the resource group.


   In this quickstart:
   + The workspace name is `my_workspace`.
   + The resource group name is `my_resource_group`

   ```azurecli
   az ml workspace create -n my_workspace -g my_resource_group
   ```

In the command-line window, create a folder on your local machine for your Azure Machine Learning project.

   ```
   mkdir myproject
   cd myproject
   ```

Attach the folder as a project to the workspace. The `--history` argument specifies a name for the run history file that captures the metrics for each run.

   ```azurecli
   az ml project attach --history my_history -w my_workspace -g my_resource_group
   ```

## Run scripts and view output

In your local project directory, create a script and name it `pi.py`.

Copy the following code into that script:
    
   ```python
   import random, math
   from azureml.core import Run
    
   run = Run.get_submitted_run()
    
   pi_counter = 0
   n_iter = 100000
   run.log("Number of iterations",n_iter)
    
   for i in range(1,n_iter):
       x = random.random()
       y = random.random()
       if x*x + y*y < 1.0:
           pi_counter += 1
       pi_value = 4.0*pi_counter / i
       if i%10000==0:
           error = math.pi-pi_value
           print(i, pi_value, error)
           run.log_row("Pi estimate",iteration=i,pi_value=pi_value)
           run.log_row("Error",iteration=i,error=error)
   ```

Run the script on your local computer.

   ```azurecli
   az ml run submit -c local pi.py
   ```

   This command runs the code and outputs a web link to your console. Copy-paste the link into your web browser.

In a web browser, visit the URL. A web portal appears with the results of the run. You can inspect the results of that run or previous runs, if they exist.

## Clean up resources 

[!INCLUDE [aml-delete-resource-group](../../../includes/aml-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Next steps
You have now created the necessary resources to start experimenting and deploying models. You also created a project, ran a script, and explored the run history of the script.

For an in-depth workflow experience, follow the Azure Machine Learning tutorial on building, training, and deploying a model.
