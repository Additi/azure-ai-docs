# Quickstart: Install and get started with Azure Machine Learning CLI Extension

You can use Azure Machine Learning Python CLI Extension (Azure ML CLI)

This quickstart shows you how to:

* Install the Azure ML CLI
* Create Azure ML Workspace and Project
* Train a basic machine learning model

As part of the Microsoft Azure portfolio, Azure Machine Learning services require an Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

Additionally, you must have adequate permissions to create assets such as Resource Groups, Virtual Machines, and so on. 

<a name="prerequisites"></a>You can install the Azure ML CLI on a Windows, Linux or MacOS computer with following prerequisites installed:

* Python 3.5 or higher
* Azure CLI 2.0

## Install Azure ML CLI

>[!NOTE]
>The installation can take several minutes to complete.

On your computer, open command line editor and install the Azure ML CLI extension

```azurecli
az extension add <EXACT COMMAND TBD>
```

## Log in to your Azure Subscription and create resource group


1. Log in to your Azure subscription.

   From command line, run following command and follow the prompts for interactive login:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

 2. Check which Azure subscriptions are available to you, and set an active one. 
 
    Select the SubscriptionId value from the output of *az account list* command.

    ```azurecli
    az account list --output table
    az account set --subscription <SubscriptionId>
    az account show
    ```

   3. Create Azure resource group to hold your Workspace

      Supported location choices are eastus2, others TBD

      ```azurecli
      az group create --name myrg --location eastus2
      ```

## Create Azure ML Workspace

Azure ML Workspace is the top-level Azure resource that contains your run histories, compute resources, models, and deployments.

1. Create Workspace under the resource group 

    ```
    az ml workspace create --name myws --group myrg
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >In addition to Azure ML Workspace, this command creates storage account, Azure Container Registry, Azure Key Vault and AppInsights resources under your resource group.

## Attach Project

In Azure Machine Learning, a project is a local folder. It contain the scripts you use to solve your machine learning problem, and configuration files that attach it to your workspace in Azure Cloud.

1. Create a folder for your project

    ```
    mkdir myproject
    cd myproject
    ```

2. Attach the folder as a Azure ML project. The *history* argument specifies the name of run history used to group together and track your runs.

    ```azurecli
    az ml project attach --history myhistory -w myws
    ```

## Run a Python script

1. Copy script to your project folder.

    Copy hello.py (Location and content TBD) script to your project folder.

2. Run hello.py script on your local computer.

    ```azurecli
    az ml run submit -c local hello.py
    ```

3. View results of your run.

    The run should output a web link to your console. Copy-paste this link to your web browser and open it. This opens a web portal view that shows the results of your run.

## Next steps

You have now created the necessary Azure Machine Learning resources to start experimenting and deploying models.

For a more in-depth experience of this workflow, follow the full-length *TBD* tutorial.
