# How to migrate to the latest version of Azure Machine Learning Services 

In this article, you'll learn which assets and artifacts you can migrate and how to get them working in the generally available version of Azure Machine Learning Services. This article is for pre-GA users who have the Workbench application installed on their machines and/or experimentation and model management accounts. For more information, see the article "[What happened to Workbench?](overview-what-happened-to-workbench.md)"

Generally speaking, most of the artifacts created in the pre-GA version of Azure Machine Learning Services are stored in your own local or cloud storage. So the migration path largely involves re-registering them with the new Azure Machine Learning offering. 

At a glance, you can continue to use the following assets:
+ Your Azure subscription and resource group
+ Your scoring files
+ Your model file dependencies, environment, and schema files
+ Deployed web services

## Azure resources

Resources such as the pre-GA Azure Machine Learning experimentation accounts, Azure Machine Learning model management accounts, and machine learning compute environments do not work with in the generally available version of Azure Machine Learning Services and cannot be migrated. 

You can get started with the GA version by creating an Azure Machine Learning Workspace [in Python](quickstart-set-up-in-python.md), using [the CLI](quickstart-set-up-in-cli.md), or in the [Azure portal](how-to-create-workspace-in-portal.md). This workspace enables you to use all features of the generally available features of Azure Machine Learning Services. Learn more about [the new architecture](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md).

## Projects

Instead of having your projects in a workspace in the cloud, projects are now directories on your local machine in the latest release.

To migrate your projects, attach the local directory containing your scripts to your newly created Azure Machine Learning Workspace. When you attach that project to the workspace, you can also start a run history file in the workspace for that project by specifying a name for that history.  

* With the updated CLI extension:
    ```shell
    $ az ml project attach -w <my_workspace> -p <proj_folder_path> --history <run_history_name>
    ```
  Learn how to create a workspace and attach a project in the [CLI quickstart](quickstart-set-up-in-cli.md).

* With the new Python SDK:
    ```python
    from azureml.core import Workspace, Project
    
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    proj = Project.attach(workspace_object=ws, run_history='my history', directory='c:\projects\mnist')
    ```
  Learn how to create a workspace and attach a project in the [SDK quickstart](quickstart-set-up-in-python.md).

## Deployed web services

The web services you deployed with your Model Management account will continue to work for as long as Azure Container Service (ACS) is still supported.  However, when support for the previous CLI ends, you won't be able to manage those web services anymore. 

In the newer version of Azure Machine Learning Services, models are deployed as web services to Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters. 

To migrate your web services, redeploy your models using the new SDK or CLI to the new targets, ACI, or AKS. There is no need to change your original scoring file, model file dependencies files, environment file, and schema files.

## Run history records

While you can't continue adding to your existing run histories under the old workspace, you can export the histories you have using the previous CLI. In th

To export the run history with previous CLI:

```Azure CLI
# list all runs
$ az ml history list

# get details about a particular run
$ az ml history info

# download all artifacts of a run
$ az ml history download
```

## Data Prep files
TBD ...
