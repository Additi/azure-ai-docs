# Samples: Use Jupyter Notebooks to explore Azure Machine Learning service

For your convenience, we have developed a series of Jupyter Python notebooks you can use to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. Learn how to use the service with the documentation on this site and use these notebooks to customize them to your situation.  

## **Azure Notebooks** - Free Jupyter based notebooks in the Azure cloud
The SDK is already installed and configured for you on Azure Notebooks.
  
1. Complete the [getting started quickstart](../articles/machine-learning/service/quickstart-get-started.md) to create a workspace and launch Azure Notebooks.

1. Go to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)

1. In the `Getting Started` Library you created during the quickstart, go to the `tutorials` folder

1. Open the notebook.

## **Your own Jupyter notebook server**

1. Complete the [getting started with Python SDK quickstart](../articles/machine-learning/service/quickstart-create-workspace-with-python.md) to install the SDK and create a workspace.

1. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/aml-notebooks).

1. Copy the `aml_config` directory you created during the quickstart into your cloned directory.

1. Start the notebook server from your cloned directory.

1. Go to the `tutorials` folder.

1. Open the notebook.
