# Use Jupyter notebooks to explore Azure Machine Learning service


For your convenience, we have developed a series of Jupyter Python notebooks you can use to explore the Azure Machine Learning service. 

Learn how to use the service with the documentation on this site and use these notebooks to customize them to your situation. 

## Prerequisite

Complete the [Azure Machine Learning Python quickstart](quickstart-get-started.md) to create a workspace and launch Azure Notebooks.

## Try Azure Notebooks: Free Jupyter notebooks in the cloud

It's easy to get started with Azure Notebooks! The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://aka.ms/aml-sdk) is already installed and configured for you on Azure Notebooks. The installation and future updates are automatically managed via Azure services.
  
+ To run the **core tutorial notebooks**:
  1. Go to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/).
    
  1. Find the **tutorials** folder in the  **Getting Started** library you created during the prerequisite quickstart.
    
  1. Open the notebook you want to run.
    
+ To run **other notebooks**:

  1. [Import the sample notebooks](https://aka.ms/aml-clone-azure-notebooks) into Azure Notebooks.

  1. Add a workspace configuration file to the library using either of these methods:
     + Copy the **config.json** file from the **Getting Started** Library into the new cloned library.

     + Create a new workspace using code in the [00.configuration.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/00.configuration.ipynb).
    
  1. Open the notebook you want to run.     


## Use a Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)

The [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://aka.ms/aml-sdk) and notebook server are already installed and configured for you on a DSVM. Use these steps run the notebooks.

1. [Create a DSVM](how-to-configure-environment.md#dsvm).

1. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/aml-notebooks).

1. Add a workspace configuration file to the library using either of these methods:
    * Copy the **aml_config\config.json** file you created using the prerequisite quickstart into the cloned directory.

    * Create a new workspace using code in the [00.configuration.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/00.configuration.ipynb).

1. Start the notebook server from your cloned directory.

## Use your own Jupyter notebook server

Use these steps to create a local Jupyter Notebook server on your computer.

1. Ensure you've completed the prerequisite quickstart in which you installed the Azure Machine Learning SDKs.

1. Clone [the GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/aml-notebooks).

1. Add a workspace configuration file to the library using either of these methods:
    * Copy the **aml_config\config.json** file you created using the prerequisite quickstart into the cloned directory.
    
    * Create a new workspace using code in the [00.configuration.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks/blob/master/00.configuration.ipynb).

1. Start the notebook server from your cloned directory.

1. Go to the folder containing the notebook.

1. Open the notebook.
