# What is the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python?

The Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python empowers data scientists and AI developers build end-to-end machine learning workflows upon Azure Machine Learning Services. With this SDK, you can interact with the service in any Python environment, including Jupyter Notebooks or your favorite Python IDE.

Use this SDK to quickly build, train, and deploy highly accurate machine learning and deep learning models for various domains. 

## Install the SDK

[!INCLUDE [aml-install-sdk](../../../includes/aml-install-sdk.md)]

## Learn how to use it

Try these next steps to learn how to use this Azure Machine Learning Services SDK for Python:
1. Install the SDK.
2. [Follow the tutorial](tutorial-build-train-deploy-with-azure-machine-learning.md) to learn how to build, train, and deploy a model in Python.
3. Look up classes and modules in [the reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure-machine-learning/).
