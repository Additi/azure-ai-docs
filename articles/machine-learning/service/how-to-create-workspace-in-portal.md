# Create a Workspace using Azure portal

To get started using Azure Machine Learning, you need a workspace. This page shows how you can quickly and easily create a workspace using the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To step through this how-to guide, you need an Azure account.

## Create a Workspace 

The workspace creation experience starts in the Azure portal. You should click on Create a resource in the top left corner of screen. In the “Search the Marketplace” box, type Machine Learning and select Machine Learning Workplace from the list of suggestions.

You can also press enter and select Machine Learning Workspace from search results.

To create a workspace, click on Machine Learning Workspace to open the creation page.

Once you click on create, a new window will appear. Here, you need to complete some basic fields to create a workspace. The first step is to name the workspace that will be created. In this example, let's name it _MyWorkspace_. Next, you need to select a subscription. Third, you need to either create a new resource group or use an existing one. In this example, let's use an existing resource group called _Group_. Finally, you need to select the geographical region where the workspace will be created. Once all these input fields are completed, then click on Create.

After clicking on create, a request will be submitted to Azure to provision the workspace. You can check the deployment progress by clicking on the notifications icon in top right section of portal.

When this stage is complete, you will see a message informing you that the deployment has succeeded.

## View a Workspace

To check your newly created workspace, you can click on All service in top left corner of the portal, search, and select Machine Learning Workspace.

You are now able to see all Machine Learning Workspaces that have been created. You can filter based on subscription, resource groups, and locations.  In this example, you can see the MyWorkspace you created in the previous step.
