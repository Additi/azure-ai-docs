# How to choose algorithms for Microsoft Azure Machine Learning
The answer to the question "What machine learning algorithm should I use?" is always "It depends." It depends on the size, quality, and nature of the data. It depends on what you want to do with the answer. It depends on how the math of the algorithm was translated into instructions for the computer you are using. And it depends on how much time you have. Even the most experienced data scientists can't tell which algorithm will perform best before trying them.

## The Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet
The **Machine Learning Algorithm Cheat Sheet** helps you choose the right machine learning algorithm for your predictive analytics solutions from the large family of machine learning algorithms.
This article walks you through how to use it.

This cheat sheet has a very specific audience in mind: a beginning data scientist with undergraduate-level machine learning, trying to choose an algorithm to start with. That means that it makes some generalizations and oversimplifications, but it points you in a safe direction. It also means that there are lots of algorithms not listed here.

These recommendations are compiled feedback and tips from many data scientists and machine learning experts. We didn't agree on everything, but we've tried to harmonize our opinions into a rough consensus. Most of the statements of disagreement begin with "It depends…"

### How to use the cheat sheet

Read the path and algorithm labels on the chart as "For *&lt;path
label&gt;*, use *&lt;algorithm&gt;*." For example, "For *speed*, use *two
class logistic regression*." Sometimes more than one branch applies.
Sometimes none of them are a perfect fit. They're intended to be
rule-of-thumb recommendations, so don't worry about it being exact.
Several data scientists we talked with said that the only sure way to
find the very best algorithm is to try all of them.

Here's an example from the [Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/) of an experiment (using Azure Machine Learning Studio) that tries
several algorithms against the same data and compares the results:

recognition](https://gallery.azure.ai/Experiment/a635502fc98b402a890efe21cec65b92).

## Flavors of machine learning

### Supervised

Supervised learning algorithms make predictions based on a set of
examples. For instance, historical stock prices can be used to hazard
guesses at future prices. Each example used for training is labeled with
the value of interest—in this case the stock price. A supervised
learning algorithm looks for patterns in those value labels. It can use
any information that might be relevant—the day of the week, the season,
the company's financial data, the type of industry, the presence of
disruptive geopolitical events—and each algorithm looks for different
types of patterns. After the algorithm has found the best pattern it
can, it uses that pattern to make predictions for unlabeled testing
data—tomorrow's prices.

Supervised learning is a popular and useful type of machine learning. There are several specific types of supervised learning: classification, regression, and anomaly detection.

* **Classification**. When the data are being used to predict a
  category, supervised learning is also called classification. This is
  the case when assigning an image as a picture of either a 'cat' or a
  'dog'. When there are only two choices, it's called **two-class**
  or **binomial classification**. When there are more categories, as
  when predicting the winner of the NCAA March Madness tournament, this
  problem is known as **multi-class classification**.
* **Regression**. When a value is being predicted, as with stock prices,
  supervised learning is called regression.
* **Anomaly detection**. Sometimes the goal is to identify data points
  that are simply unusual. In fraud detection, for example, any highly
  unusual credit card spending patterns are suspect. The possible
  variations are so numerous and the training examples so few, that it's
  not feasible to learn what fraudulent activity looks like. The
  approach that anomaly detection takes is to simply learn what normal
  activity looks like (using a history non-fraudulent transactions) and
  identify anything that is significantly different.

### Unsupervised

In unsupervised learning, data points have no labels associated with
them. Instead, the goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to
organize the data in some way or to describe its structure. This can
mean grouping it into clusters or finding different ways of looking at
complex data so that it appears simpler or more organized.

### Reinforcement learning

In reinforcement learning, the algorithm gets to choose an action in
response to each data point. The learning algorithm also receives a
reward signal a short time later, indicating how good the decision was.
Based on this, the algorithm modifies its strategy in order to achieve
the highest reward. Reinforcement learning is common in
robotics, where the set of sensor readings at one point in time is a
data point, and the algorithm must choose the robot's next action. It is
also a natural fit for Internet of Things applications.

## Considerations when choosing an algorithm

### Accuracy

Getting the most accurate answer possible isn't always necessary.
Sometimes an approximation is adequate, depending on what you want to
use it for. If that's the case, you may be able to cut your processing
time dramatically by sticking with more approximate methods. Another
advantage of more approximate methods is that they naturally tend to
avoid [overfitting](https://youtu.be/DQWI1kvmwRg).

### Training time

The number of minutes or hours necessary to train a model varies a great
deal between algorithms. Training time is often closely tied to
accuracy—one typically accompanies the other. In addition, some
algorithms are more sensitive to the number of data points than others.
When time is limited it can drive the choice of algorithm, especially
when the data set is large.

### Linearity

Lots of machine learning algorithms make use of linearity. Linear
classification algorithms assume that classes can be separated by a
straight line (or its higher-dimensional analog). These include logistic
regression and support vector machines (as implemented in Azure Machine Learning).
Linear regression algorithms assume that data trends follow a straight
line. These assumptions aren't bad for some problems, but on others they
bring accuracy down.

![Non-linear class boundary][1]

***Non-linear class boundary*** *- relying on a linear classification
algorithm would result in low accuracy*

![Data with a nonlinear trend][2]

***Data with a nonlinear trend*** *- using a linear regression method would
generate much larger errors than necessary*

Despite their dangers, linear algorithms are very popular as a first
line of attack. They tend to be algorithmically simple and fast to
train.

### Number of parameters

Parameters are the knobs a data scientist gets to turn when setting up
an algorithm. They are numbers that affect the algorithm's behavior,
such as error tolerance or number of iterations, or options between
variants of how the algorithm behaves. The training time and accuracy of
the algorithm can sometimes be quite sensitive to getting just the right
settings. Typically, algorithms with large numbers of parameters require
the most trial and error to find a good combination.

The upside is that having many parameters typically indicates that an
algorithm has greater flexibility. It can often achieve very good
accuracy provided you can find the right combination of parameter
settings.

### Number of features

For certain types of data, the number of features can be very large
compared to the number of data points. This is often the case with
genetics or textual data. The large number of features can bog down some
learning algorithms, making training time very long. Support
Vector Machines are particularly well suited to this case (see below).

### Special cases

Some learning algorithms make particular assumptions about the structure
of the data or the desired results. If you can find one that fits your
needs, it can give you more useful results, more accurate predictions,
or faster training times.

## Algorithm notes

### Linear regression

As mentioned previously, linear regression
fits a line (or plane, or hyperplane) to the data set. It's a workhorse,
simple and fast, but it may be overly simplistic for some problems.

![Data with a linear trend][3]

***Data with a linear trend***

### Logistic regression

Although it confusingly includes 'regression' in the name, logistic
regression is actually a powerful tool for
two-class
and
multiclass]
classification. It's fast and simple. The fact that it uses an
'S'-shaped curve instead of a straight line makes it a natural fit for
dividing data into groups. Logistic regression gives linear class
boundaries, so when you use it, make sure a linear approximation is
something you can live with.

![Logistic regression to two-class data with just one feature][4]

***A logistic regression to two-class data with just one feature*** *- the
class boundary is the point at which the logistic curve is just as close to both classes*

### Trees, forests, and jungles

Decision forests (regression, two-class, and multiclass), decision jungles (two-class and multiclass), and boosted decision trees (regression and two-class)
are all based on decision trees, a foundational machine learning
concept. There are many variants of decision trees, but they all do the
same thing—subdivide the feature space into regions with mostly the same
label. These can be regions of consistent category or of constant value,
depending on whether you are doing classification or regression.

![Decision tree subdivides a feature space][5]

***A decision tree subdivides a feature space into regions of roughly
uniform values***

Because a feature space can be subdivided into arbitrarily small
regions, it's easy to imagine dividing it finely enough to have one data
point per region. This is an extreme example of overfitting. 
In order to avoid this, a large set of trees are constructed with special mathematical care taken that the trees are not correlated. The average of this "decision forest" is a tree that avoids overfitting. Decision forests
can use a lot of memory. Decision jungles are a variant that consumes
less memory at the expense of a slightly longer training time.

Boosted decision trees avoid overfitting by limiting how many times they
can subdivide and how few data points are allowed in each region. The
algorithm constructs a sequence of trees, each of which learns to
compensate for the error left by the tree before. The result is a very
accurate learner that tends to use a lot of memory. For the full
technical description, check out [Friedman's original
paper](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/trebst.pdf).

Fast forest quantile regression
is a variation of decision trees for the special case where you want to
know not only the typical (median) value of the data within a region,
but also its distribution in the form of quantiles.

### Neural networks and perceptrons

Neural networks are brain-inspired learning algorithms covering multiclass, two-class, and regression problems. They come in an infinite variety, but the neural networks
within Azure Machine Learning are all of the form of directed acyclic graphs. That
means that input features are passed forward (never backward) through a
sequence of layers before being turned into outputs. In each layer,
inputs are weighted in various combinations, summed, and passed on to
the next layer. This combination of simple calculations results in the
ability to learn sophisticated class boundaries and data trends,
seemingly by magic. Many-layered networks of this sort perform the "deep
learning" that fuels so much tech reporting and science fiction.

This high performance doesn't come for free, though. Neural networks can
take a long time to train, particularly for large data sets with lots of
features. They also have more parameters than most algorithms, which
means that parameter sweeping expands the training time a great deal.
And for those overachievers who wish to specify their own network
structure, the
possibilities are inexhaustible.

![Boundaries learned by neural networks][6]
***The boundaries learned by neural networks can be complex and
irregular***

The two-class averaged
perceptron
is neural networks' answer to skyrocketing training times. It uses a
network structure that gives linear class boundaries. It is almost
primitive by today's standards, but it has a long history of working
robustly and is small enough to learn quickly.

### SVMs

Support vector machines (SVMs) find the boundary that separates classes
by as wide a margin as possible. When the two classes can't be clearly
separated, the algorithms find the best boundary they can. 
One form of two-class SVM does
this with a straight line only (in SVM-speak, it uses a linear kernel).
Because it makes this linear approximation, it is able to run fairly
quickly. Where it really shines is with feature-intense data, like text
or genomic. In these cases SVMs are able to separate classes more
quickly and with less overfitting than most other algorithms, in
addition to requiring only a modest amount of memory.

![Support vector machine class boundary][7]

***A typical support vector machine class boundary maximizes the margin
separating two classes***

The two-class locally deep SVM is a
non-linear variant of SVM that retains most of the speed and memory
efficiency of the linear version. It is ideal for cases where the linear
approach doesn't give accurate enough answers. The developers keep it
fast by breaking down the problem into a bunch of small linear SVM
problems. Read the [full
description](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/jose13.html)
for the details on how Microsoft Research pulled off this trick.

Using a clever extension of nonlinear SVMs, the one-class SVM draws
a boundary that tightly outlines the entire data set. It is useful for
anomaly detection. Any new data points that fall far outside that
boundary are unusual enough to be noteworthy.

### Bayesian methods

Bayesian methods have a highly desirable quality: they avoid
overfitting. They do this by making some assumptions beforehand about
the likely distribution of the answer. Another byproduct of this
approach is that they have very few parameters. 

On a historical note, Bayes' point machines were developed at Microsoft
Research. They have some exceptionally beautiful theoretical work behind
them. The interested student is directed to the [original article in
JMLR](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume1/herbrich01a/herbrich01a.pdf) and an
[insightful blog by Chris
Bishop](http://blogs.technet.com/b/machinelearning/archive/2014/10/30/embracing-uncertainty-probabilistic-inference.aspx).
