# Train models automatically in the cloud

Azure Machine Learning can automatically train your model in several different environments. These environments, called compute targets, could be local or in the cloud. 


You easily scale up or scale out your machine learning experiment by adding additional compute targets such as Ubuntu-based Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). The DSVM is a customized VM image on Microsoftâ€™s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured.  

In this article, you learn how to perform automated model selection on the DSVM.  

## How does remote differ from local?

The tutorial "[Automatically train a classification model](tutorial-auto-train-models.md)" teaches you how to use a local target for automated modeling.  The workflow when training locally also applies to  remote targets as well. 

This article explains the code needed to perform automated modeling on a remote DSVM instead.  The workspace object, `ws`, from the tutorial is used throughout the code here.

```python
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

## Create resource

Create the DSVM in your workspace (`ws`) if it does not already exist. If the DSVM was previously created, this code skips the creation process and loads the existing resource detail into the `dsvm_compute` object.  

**Time estimate**: Creation of the VM takes approximately 5 minutes.

```python
from azureml.core.compute import DsvmCompute

dsvm_name = 'mydsvm' #Name your DSVM
try:
    dsvm_compute = DsvmCompute(ws, dsvm_name)
    print('found existing dsvm.')
except:
    print('creating new dsvm.')
    dsvm_config = DsvmCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size = "Standard_D2_v2")
    dsvm_compute = DsvmCompute.create(ws, name = dsvm_name, provisioning_configuration = dsvm_config)
    dsvm_compute.wait_for_provisioning(show_output = True)
```

You can now use the `dsvm_compute` object as the remote compute target.

DSVM name restrictions include:
+ Must be shorter than 64 characters.  
+ Cannot include any of the following characters: 
  `\` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) = + _ [ ] { } \\\\ | ; : \' \\" , < > / ?.`

>[!Warning]
>If creation fails with a message about Marketplace purchase eligibility:
>    1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
>    1. Start creating a DSVM 
>    1. Select "Want to create programmatically" to enable programmatic creation
>    1. Exist without actually creating the VM
>    1. Rerun the creation code


## Configure resource

Configure the remote resource with the development environment needed to run your training code.  This includes:

* Any required `conda` or `pip` installs
* The compute target (`dsvm_compute`)
* Flag to automatically prepare the remote environment (set to `True`)
* An **aml_config** directory that includes a conda dependency file


```python
# create the directory if necessary
import os 
if not os.path.exists(project_folder): 
    os.makedirs(project_folder) 
    if not os.path.exists(project_folder + "/aml_config"): 
        os.makedirs(project_folder + "/aml_config")

# specify the dependencies
from azureml.core.runconfig import CondaDependencies
cd = CondaDependencies()
cd.add_conda_package(conda_package="numpy") 
cd.add_pip_package(pip_package="azureml-sdk[automl]")

# create the run configuration to use for remote training
from azureml.core.runconfig import RunConfiguration
run_config = RunConfiguration(conda_dependencies=cd) 
# set the target to dsvm_compute created above
run_config.target = dsvm_compute 
run_config.auto_prepare_environment = True 
# save the conda dependencies to the aml_config folder 
run_config.save(path = project_folder, name = dsvm_name)
```

You can now use the `run_config` object as the target for automatic training. 

## Access data

Provide the remote resource access to your training data.  

To provide access, you must:
+ Create a get_data.py file containing a `get_data()` function 
* Place that file in the root directory of the folder containing your scripts 

You can encapsulate code to read data from a blob storage or local disk in the get_data.py file. In the following code sample, the data comes from the sklearn package.


```python
%%writefile $project_folder/get_data.py

from sklearn import datasets
from scipy import sparse
import numpy as np

def get_data():
    
    digits = datasets.load_digits()
    X_digits = digits.data[10:,:]
    y_digits = digits.target[10:]

    return { "X" : X_digits, "y" : y_digits }
```

## Configure automatic training

Specify the settings for `AutoMLConfig`.  (See a [full list of parameters]() and their possible values.)

In the settings, `run_configuration` is set to the `run_config` object, which contains the settings and configuration for the DSVM.  

```python
from azureml.train.automl import AutoMLConfig
import time
import logging

automl_settings = {
    "name": "AutoML_Demo_Experiment_{0}".format(time.time()),
    "max_time_sec": 600,
    "iterations": 20,
    "n_cross_validations": 5,
    "primary_metric": 'AUC_weighted',
    "preprocess": False,
    "concurrent_iterations": 10,
    "verbosity": logging.INFO
}

automl_config = AutoMLConfig(task = 'classification',
                             debug_log = 'automl_errors.log',
                             path=project_folder,
                             run_configuration = run_config,
                             data_script = project_folder + "./get_data.py",
                             **automl_settings
                            )
```

## Submit automatic training

Now submit the configuration to automatically select the algorithm, tune, and train the model using the `submit()` method with `automl_config`. 

```python
remote_run = experiment.submit(automl_config, show_output=True)
```

(Learn [more information about parameters]() for the `submit` method.)

## Explore results

You can use the same Jupyter widget as the one in [this tutorial](tutorial-auto-train-models.md#explore-the-results) to see a graph and table of results.
You can click on any bar at the top of the widget to see run properties and output logs.

Find logs on the DSVM under /tmp/azureml_run/{iterationid}/azureml-logs

The widget displays a URL you can use to see and explore the individual run details.
 
```python
from azureml.train.widgets import RunDetails
RunDetails(remote_run).show()
```

## View status of DSVM
You can iterate through all runs in your experiment and view the DSVM status and run history.

```python
import azureml.core
import pandas as pd
from azureml.core.workspace import Workspace
from azureml.core.history import History
from azureml.core.run import Run
project_name = 'automl-remote-dsvm' # Ensure this matches your project name

proj = History(ws, project_name)
summary_df = pd.DataFrame(index = ['Type', 'Status', 'Primary Metric', 'Iterations', 'Compute', 'Name'])
import re
pattern = re.compile('^AutoML_[^_]*$')
all_runs = list(proj.get_runs())
for run in all_runs:
    if(pattern.match(run.id)):
        properties = run.get_properties()
        amlsettings = eval(properties['RawAMLSettingsString'])
        summary_df[run.id] = [amlsettings['task_type'], run.get_details().status, properties['primary_metric'], properties['num_iterations'], properties['target'], amlsettings['name']]
    
from IPython.display import HTML
projname_html = HTML("<h3>{}</h3>".format(proj.name))

from IPython.display import display
display(projname_html)
display(summary_df.T)
```
