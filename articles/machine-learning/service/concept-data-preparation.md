# Prepare your data for modeling
 
Data preparation is an important part of a machine learning workflow. Your models will be more accurate and efficient if they have access to clean data in a format that is easier to consume. You can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/dataprep?view=azure-dataprep-py">Azure Machine Learning Data Prep SDK</a> to load data of various formats, transform it to be more usable, and write that data to a location for your models to access. 


## Steps for data preparation with Azure Machine Learning 
1. [Load data](how-to-load-data.md )
2. [Transform data](how-to-transform-data.md )
3. [Write data](how-to-write-data.md )
