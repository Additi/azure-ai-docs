#What happened to Azure Machine Learning Workbench?
 
Followed by an intro paragraph on how AML went GA in July 2018 and with it we’ve changed the architecture (link out) and replaced the workbench with an easy to use comprehensive SDK.
 
##For how long can I still use the desktop Workbench?
Answer that. We can also point them to the deprecated docs if they intend to stay on 3RP for a while longer.
 
##How much has Azure Machine Learning Services changed?
In this generally available release, we’ve redesigned the architecture (link) and this and that based on the rich customer feedback we received during the initial public preview phase. Link out to your blog on the product announcement - what’s new on MSDN and a link to the new Quickstart to get started.
 
##How will I prepare data?
(Short answer followed by links to Quickstarts and tutorials that help someone get started with GA functionality)
 
## Will my web services still work?
(Explain what will and what won’t. If they need to do some migration work, point off to that section)
 
## Will run histories persist?
How do I migrate to generally available release of Azure Machine Learning?
(If this section gets too long, we may need another article for the next 8 months specific to migration)
 
## How do I build and deploy models now?
Process hasn’t changed, but a new SDK and CLI have been released to support the process. Learn how with this tutorial…
 
## Will the SDK and CLI continue to work?
Yes, for a while. But we’ve invested more and have cool new ones. Check ‘em out.
 
## Will my experimentation and model management accounts continue to work?
 
## How do I migrate my work?
Briefly summarize how much can be migrated and then point them to the new article on How to migrate.
