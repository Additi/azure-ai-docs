# How to Use Datastores
In Azure Machine Learning services, a datastore is an abstraction over [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction). The datastore can either use an [Azure Blob](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction) container, [Azure file share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction), or [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/data-lake-storage/introduction) (ADLS) as the backend storage. Datastores allow you to easily access and interact with your data storage during your Azure Machine Learning workflows via the Python SDK or CLI.

## Create a datastore
In order to use datastores, you will first need a [workspace](). You can either create a new workspace or retrieve an existing one:

```Python
import azureml.core
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

### Use the default datastore
Each workspace has a default datastore that you can start using immediately, which saves you the work of creating and configuring your own storage accounts.

To get the workspace's default datastore:
```Python
ds = ws.get_default_datastore()
```

### Register a datastore
If you already have existing Azure Storage, you can register it as a datastore on your workspace. Azure ML provides the functionality to register an Azure Blob Container, Azure File Share, or Azure Data Lake as a datastore. All the register methods are on the `Datastore` class and have the form `register_azure_*`.

#### Azure Blob Container Datastore
To register an Azure Blob Container datastore:

```Python
ds = Datastore.register_azure_blob_container(workspace=ws, 
                                            datastore_name='your datastore name', 
                                            container_name='your azure blob container name',
                                            account_name='your storage account name', 
                                            account_key='your storage account key',
                                            create_if_not_exists=True)
```

#### Azure File Share Datastore
To register an Azure File Share datastore:

```Python
ds = Datastore.register_azure_file_share(workspace=ws, 
                                        datastore_name='your datastore name', 
                                        container_name='your file share name',
                                        account_name='your storage account name', 
                                        account_key='your storage account key',
                                        create_if_not_exists=True)
```

#### Azure Data Lake Datastore
To register an Azure Data Lake datastore:

```Python
ds = Datastore.register_azure_data_lake(workspace=ws, 
                                        datastore_name='your datastore name', 
                                        store_name='your ADLS store name',
                                        tenant_id='the Directory ID/Tenant ID of the service principal',
                                        cliend_id='the Client ID/Application ID of the service principal',
                                        client_secret='the secret of the service principal')
```


For registering an Azure Blob Container or Azure File Share, if you want to use a SAS token, provide the token to the `sas_token` parameter of the `Datastore.register_azure_*` function. You must use an [account SAS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1#types-of-shared-access-signatures).

### Get an existing datastore
To query for a registered datastore by name:
```Python
ds = Datastore.get(ws, datastore_name='your datastore name')
```

You can also get a list of all the datastores for a workspace:
```Python
for ds in ws.datastores():
    print(ds.name, ds.datastore_type)
```

For convenience, if you would like to set one of your registered datastores as the default datastore for your workspace, you can do so as follows:
```Python
ws.set_default_datastore('your datastore name')
```

## Upload and download data
### Upload
For datastores of type `AzureBlobDatastore` and `AzureFileDatastore`, you can upload either a directory or individual files to the datastore using the Python SDK.

To upload a directory to a datastore `ds`:
```Python
ds.upload(src_dir='your source directory',
          target_path='your target path',
          overwrite=True,
          show_progress=True)
```
`target_path` specifies the location in the file share (or blob container) to upload. It defaults to `None`, in which case the data gets uploaded to root. `overwrite=True` will overwrite any existing data at `target_path`.

You can alternatively upload a list of individual files to the datastore via the [`upload_files`]() method.

### Download
Similarly, you can download data from a datastore to your local file system for datastores of type `AzureBlobDatastore` and `AzureFileDatastore`.

```Python
ds.download(target_path='your target path',
            prefix='your prefix',
            show_progress=True)
```
`target_path` is the location of the local directory to download the data to. To specify a path to the folder in the file share (or blob container) to download, provide that path to `prefix`. If `prefix` is `None`, all the contents of your file share (or blob container) will get downloaded.

## Use datastore for training
You can access a datastore during a training run (e.g. for training or validation data) on a remote compute target via the Python SDK. 

First, you need to create a `DataReference` object from your datastore and pass it to an [Estimator]() that submits your training job to the compute target. A `DataReference` represents a particular path in a datastore. This path could be the root `/`, a directory within the datastore, or a specific file in the datastore.

Currently, there are two supported ways to make your datastore available on the remote compute:
* **Mount**  
`ds.as_mount(path_on_compute='your path on compute)'` creates a `DataReference` object with mount mode, so that the datastore will get mounted for you on the remote compute at the relative path location specified by `path_on_compute` (or at the root if `path_on_compute`=None). 
* **Download**  
`ds.as_download(path_on_compute='your path on compute)` creates a `DataReference` object with download mode. With this mode, the data will get downloaded from your datastore to the remote compute to the location specified by `path_on_compute`.

If you don't want to mount/download your entire datastore, you can instead specify a particular path. If your datastore has a directory with relative path `./foo` and you're only interested in mounting this directory to the compute target, you can do so as follows: `ds.path(path='./foo').as_mount()`

The location on the compute target of the DataReference is made available in the environment variable on the compute target, which you can pass into your training script as a command-line argument via `script_params`:

```Python
from azureml.train.estimator import Estimator
script_params = {
    '--data_dir': ds.as_mount()
}

est = Estimator(source_directory='your code directory',
                script_params=script_params,
                compute_target=compute_target,
                entry_script='train.py')
```

Alternatively, you can pass in a list of DataReferences to the `inputs` parameter of the Estimator constructor to mount/copy your datastore(s):

```Python
est = Estimator(source_directory='your code directory',
                compute_target=compute_target,
                entry_script='train.py',
                inputs=[ds1.as_mount(), ds2.as_download()])
```
The above code will mount one datastore `ds1` and download the other `ds2` to the remote compute before your training script `train.py` is invoked.
