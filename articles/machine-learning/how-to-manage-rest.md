# Create, run, and delete Azure ML resources using REST

tk applies to boilerplate. tk

There are several ways to manage your Azure ML resources. You can use the [portal](tk), [command-line interface](tk), or [Python SDK](tk). 
Or, you can use the REST API. The REST API uses HTTP verbs in a standard way to create, retrieve, update, and delete resources. The REST
API can be used from any language or tool capable of making HTTP requests. REST's straightforward structure often makes it a good choice in scripting environments and for MLOps automation. 

In this article, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Retrieve an authorization token
> * Create a properly-formatted REST request using service principal authentication
> * Use GET requests to retrieve information about Azure ML's hierarchical resources
> * Use PUT and POST requests to create and modify resources
> * Use tk authorization and score against deployed models
> * Use DELETE requests to clean up resources 


If you donâ€™t have a <service> subscription, create a free trial account...
<!--- Required, if a free trial account exists
Because tutorials are intended to help new customers use the product or
service to complete a top task, include a link to a free trial before the
first H2, if one exists. You can find listed examples in
[Write tutorials](contribute-how-to-mvc-tutorial.md)

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over
them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.--->

## Prerequisites

- workspace. You'll need your 
- Administrative REST requests use service principal authentication. Follow the steps in [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](how-to-setup-authentication#set-up-service-principal-authentication) to create a service principal in your workspace. 
- The **curl** utility. This is available in the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://aka.ms/wslinstall/) or any UNIX distribution. In PowerShell, **curl** is an alias for **Invoke-WebRequest** and `curl -d "key=val" -X POST uri` becomes `Invoke-WebRequest -Body "key=val" -Method POST -Uri uri`. tk TODO: Confirm that all my curl requests work in PS tk. This article uses curl since it is very widely available, but the [source code](tk) uses [Postman](tk), a tool that allows developers to organize requests, swap in variables, and view request and response details in an easy-to-use manner. 


## Retrieve a service principal authentication token

Administrative REST requests are authenticated by a token provided by your workspace's service principal. In order to retrieve this, you will need:

- Your tenantid (identifying the organization to which your subscription belongs)
- Your client id (which will be associated with the created token)
- Your client secret (which you should safeguard)

You should have these values from the response to the creation of your service principal (as discussed in [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](how-to-setup-authentication#set-up-service-principal-authentication). If you are using your company subscription, it is possible that you do not have sufficient permissions to create a service principal. In that case, you should use a personal subscription, such as that provided with your Visual Studio subscription or (tk free? tk)

To retrieve a token, open a terminal window and, substituting your own values as appropriate, run:

```bash
curl -d "grant_type=client_credentials&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fmanagement.azure.com%2F&client_id=your-client-id&client_secret=your-client-secret" \
-X POST https://login.microsoftonline.com/your-tenant-id/oauth2/token
```

The response should provide an access token good for one hour:

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": "3599",
    "ext_expires_in": "3599",
    "expires_on": "1578523094",
    "not_before": "1578519194",
    "resource": "https://management.azure.com/",
    "access_token": "your-access-token"
}
```

Make note of the token, as you will use it to authenticate all subsequent administrative requests. You will do so by setting an Authorization header in all requests:

```bash
curl -h "Authentication: Bearer your-access-token" ...more args...
```

Note that the value starts with the string "Bearer " including a single space before you add the token.

## Get a list of resource groups associated with your subscription

| Resource | Verb | Description | 
| ResourceGroups | GET | tk | 

To retrieve the list of resource groups associate with your subscription, run:

```bash
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups?api-version=2019-11-01 -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

Across Azure, many REST APIs are published. Each service provider updates their API on their own cadence, but must do so without breaking existing programs. The `api-version` argument varies from service to service. For the Machine Learning Service, for instance, the current API version is `2019-11-01`. For storage accounts, it's 2019-06-01. For key vaults, it's 2019-09-01. All REST calls should set the `api-version` argument to the expected value. You can rely on the syntax and semantics of the specified version even as the API continues to evolve. If you send a request to a provider without the `api-version` argument, the response will contain a human-readable list of supported values. 

The above call will result in a compacted JSON response of the form: 

```json
{
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "/subscriptions/119ec674-a66c-4b3b-8514-57cb582c4c8c/resourceGroups/RG1",
            "name": "RG1",
            "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups",
            "location": "westus2",
            "properties": {
                "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": "/subscriptions/119ec674-a66c-4b3b-8514-57cb582c4c8c/resourceGroups/RG2",
            "name": "RG2",
            "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups",
            "location": "eastus",
            "properties": {
                "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Drill down into workspaces and their resources

To retrieve the set of workspaces in a resource group, run the following, substituting `your-subscription-id`, `your-resource-group`, and `your-access-token`: 

```
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

Again you'll receive a JSON list, this time containing a list, each item of which details a workspace:

```json
{
    "id": "/subscriptions/119ec674-a66c-4b3b-8514-57cb582c4c8c/resourceGroups/DeepLearning5RG/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/laobri-rest",
    "name": "laobri-rest",
    "type": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces",
    "location": "centralus",
    "tags": {},
    "etag": null,
    "properties": {
        "friendlyName": "",
        "description": "",
        "creationTime": "2020-01-03T19:56:09.7588299+00:00",
        "storageAccount": "/subscriptions/119ec674-a66c-4b3b-8514-57cb582c4c8c/resourcegroups/deeplearning5rg/providers/microsoft.storage/storageaccounts/laobrirest0275623111",
        "containerRegistry": null,
        "keyVault": "/subscriptions/119ec674-a66c-4b3b-8514-57cb582c4c8c/resourcegroups/deeplearning5rg/providers/microsoft.keyvault/vaults/laobrirest2525649324",
        "applicationInsights": "/subscriptions/119ec674-a66c-4b3b-8514-57cb582c4c8c/resourcegroups/deeplearning5rg/providers/microsoft.insights/components/laobrirest2053523719",
        "hbiWorkspace": false,
        "workspaceId": "12284440-cb1d-494f-92f2-be4dcd7d5297",
        "subscriptionState": null,
        "subscriptionStatusChangeTimeStampUtc": null,
        "discoveryUrl": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net/discovery"
    },
    "identity": {
        "type": "SystemAssigned",
        "principalId": "353497de-bc6d-493c-820a-36d10083ecfe",
        "tenantId": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47"
    },
    "sku": {
        "name": "Basic",
        "tier": "Basic"
    }
}
```

To work with resources within a workspace, you will need to switch from the general **management.azure.com** server to a REST API server specific to the location of the workspace. Note the value of the `discoveryUrl` key in the above JSON response. If you GET that URL, you'll receive a response along the lines of:

```json
{
  "api": "https://centralus.api.azureml.ms",
  "catalog": "https://catalog.cortanaanalytics.com",
  "experimentation": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "gallery": "https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/project",
  "history": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "hyperdrive": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "labeling": "https://centralus.experiments.azureml.net",
  "modelmanagement": "https://centralus.modelmanagement.azureml.net",
  "pipelines": "https://centralus.aether.ms",
  "studiocoreservices": "https://centralus.studioservice.azureml.com"
}
```

The value of the `api` response is the URL of the server that you will use for additional requests. To list experiments, for instance, send the following. Replace `regional-api-server` with the value of the `api` response (for instance, `centralus.api.azureml.ms`). Also replace `your-subscription-id`, `your-resource-group`, `your-workspace-name`, and `your-access-token` as usual:

```bash
curl https://regional-api-server/history/v1.0/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/\
providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/your-workspace-name/experiments?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

Similarly, to retrieve registered models in your workspace, send:

```bash
curl https://regional-api-server/modelmanagement/v1.0/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/\
providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/your-workspace-name/models?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

Notice that to list experiments the path begins with `history/v1.0` while to list models, the path begins with `modelmanagement/v1.0`. The REST API is divided into several operational groups, each with a distinct path. The API Reference docs at the links below list the operations, parameters, and response codes for the various operations.

|Area|Path|Reference|
|-|-|-|
|Artifacts|artifact/v2.0/|[REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/artifacts)|
|Data stores|datastore/v1.0/|[REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/datastores)|
|Hyperparameter tuning|hyperdrive/v1.0/|[REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/hyperparametertuning)|

|Run history|execution/v1.0/ and history/v1.0/|[REST API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/runs)|

You can explore the REST API using the general pattern of:

|_|Example|
| https://| |
| regional-api-server/ | centralus.experiments.azureml.net/ |
| operations-path/ | history/v1.0/ |
| subscriptions/your-subscription-id/ | subscriptions/d2128fd5-c6c5-402a-8ffb-052d91a0a6aa/ |
| resourceGroups/your-resource-group/ | resourceGroups/MLProjectRG/ |

## Create and modify resources using PUT and POST requests

In addition to resource retrieval with the GET verb, the REST API supports the creation of many resources. Commonly, you'll want to create training runs, tune hyperparameters, register a trained model, and deploy it. All of these steps can be achieved with the REST API. 

Training and running ML models require compute resources. You can list the compute resources of a workspace with: 


```bash
curl https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/\
providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/your-workspace-name/computes?api-version=2019-11-01 \
-H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token"
```

To create or overwrite a named compute resource, you'll use a PUT request. In the following, in addition to the now-familiar substitutions of `your-subscription-id`, `your-resource-group`, `your-workspace-name`, and `your-access-token`, substitute `your-compute-name`, and values for `location`, `vmSize`, `vmPriority`, `scaleSettings`, `adminUserName`, and `adminUserPassword`. The following creates a dedicated, single-node Standard_D1 (a basic CPU compute resource) that will scale down after 30 minutes:

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/your-workspace-name/computes/your-compute-name?api-version=2019-11-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "location": "your-azure-location",
    "properties": {
        "computeType": "AmlCompute",
        "properties": {
            "vmSize": "Standard_D1",
            "vmPriority": "Dedicated",
            "scaleSettings": {
                "maxNodeCount": 1,
                "minNodeCount": 0,
                "nodeIdleTimeBeforeScaleDown": "PT30M"
            }
        }
    },
    "userAccountCredentials": {
        "adminUserName": "admin",
        "adminUserPassword": "stairway_seam_retiring_caveman"
    }
}'
```

> [!Note]
> In Windows terminals you may have to escape the double-quote symbols when sending JSON data. That is, text such as `"location"` becomes `\"location\"`. 

A successful request will get a `201 Created` response, but note that this simply means that the provisioning process has begun. You will need to poll (or use the portal) to confirm the completion. 

To start a run within an experiment, you need a zip folder containing your training script and related files, and a run definition JSON file. The zip folder must have the Python entry file in its root directory. As an example, zip a trivial Python such as the following into a folder called **train.zip**. 

```python
# hello.py
# Entry file for run
print("Hello, REST!")
```

Save the following as **definition.json**. Confirm the "Script" value matches the name of the Python file you just zipped up. Confirm the "Target" value matches the name of an available compute resource. 

```json
{
    "Configuration":{  
       "Script":"hello.py",
       "Arguments":[  
          "234"
       ],
       "SourceDirectoryDataStore":null,
       "Framework":"Python",
       "Communicator":"None",
       "Target":"cpu-compute",
       "MaxRunDurationSeconds":1200,
       "NodeCount":1,
       "Environment":{  
          "Python":{  
             "InterpreterPath":"python",
             "UserManagedDependencies":false,
             "CondaDependencies":{  
                "name":"project_environment",
                "dependencies":[  
                   "python=3.6.2",
                   {  
                      "pip":[  
                         "azureml-defaults"
                      ]
                   }
                ]
             }
          },
          "Docker":{  
             "BaseImage":"mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/base:intelmpi2018.3-ubuntu16.04"
          }
      },
       "History":{  
          "OutputCollection":true
       }
    }
}
```

Post these files to the server using `multipart/form-data` content:

```bash
curl https://regional-api-server/execution/v1.0/subscriptions/your-subscription-id/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/your-workspace/experiments/your-experiment-name/startrun?api-version=2019-11-01 \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-access-token" \
  -F projectZipFile=@train.zip \
  -F runDefinitionFile=@runDefinition.json
```

A successful POST request will generate a `200 OK` status, with a response body containing the identifier of the created run:

```json
{
  "runId": "my-first-experiment_1579642222877"
}
```

You can monitor a run using the REST-ful pattern that should now be familiar:

```bash
curl 'https://regional-api-server/history/v1.0/subscriptions/your-subscription/resourceGroups/your-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/your-workspace/experiments/your-experiment/runs/your-run-id?api-version=2019-11-01' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token' 
```

After training, but before deployment, you will want to register your model. A registered model is a logical container for one or more files that make up your model. For example, if you have a model that's stored in multiple files, you can register them as a single model in the workspace. After you register the files, you can then download or deploy the registered model and receive all the files that you registered.

~~You may have a model that you have trained entirely outside of Azure. You can register such a model by ~~

To register the outputs of a run as a model, 

tk Well, all the business of registering a model seems problematic. So skip to: 

Some, but not all, resources support the DELETE verb. Check the [API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureml/) prior to committing to the REST API for deletion use-cases. To delete a model, for instance, you can use:

```bash
curl
  -X DELETE \
'https://regional-api-server/modelmanagement/v1.0/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/{workspace}/models/{id}' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token' 
```

## Using REST on a deployed model

While it's possible to deploy a model so that it authenticates with a service principal, most client-facing deployments use key-based authentication. To authent

## Deploy a model 
The REST API also supports updating many resources. For instance,

Deployed ML Web services use token-based authentication.

<!---Required:
Tutorials are prescriptive and guide the customer through an end-to-end
procedure. Make sure to use specific naming for setting up accounts and
configuring technology.
Don't link off to other content - include whatever the customer needs to
complete the scenario in the article. For example, if the customer needs
to set permissions, include the permissions they need to set, and the
specific settings in the tutorial procedure. Don't send the customer to
another article to read about it.
In a break from tradition, do not link to reference topics in the
procedural part of the tutorial when using cmdlets or code. Provide customers what they need to know in the tutorial to successfully complete
the tutorial.
For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.
For the CLI or PowerShell based procedures, don't use bullets or
numbering.
