# Customer intent: As an experienced Python developer, I need to securely access my data in my Azure storage solutions and use it to accomplish my machine learning tasks.

# Data in Azure Machine Learning

> [!div class="op_single_selector" title1="Select the version of Azure Machine Learning developer platform you are using:"]

Azure Machine Learning makes it easy to connect to your data in the cloud. It provides an abstraction layer over the underlying storage service, so you can securely access and work with your data without having to write code specific to your storage type. Azure Machine Learning also provides the following data capabilities:

*    Interoperability with Pandas and Spark DataFrames
*    Versioning and tracking of data lineage
*    Data labeling

You can bring data to Azure Machine Learning 

* Directly from your local machine and URLs

* That's already in a cloud-based storage service in Azure and access it using your [Azure storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md?tabs=azure-portal) related credentials and an Azure Machine Learning datastore.

## Connect to storage with datastores

Azure Machine Learning datastores securely keep the connection information to your data storage on Azure, so you don't have to code it in your scripts. 

You can access your data and create datastores with, 
* [Credential-based data authentication](how-to-access-data.md), like a service principal or shared access signature (SAS) token. These credentials can be accessed by users who have *Reader* access to the workspace. 
* [Identity-based data authentication](how-to-identity-based-data-access.md) to connect to storage services with your Azure Active Directory ID. 

The following table summarizes which cloud-based storage services in Azure can be registered as datastores and what authentication type can be used to access them. 

Supported storage service | Credential-based authentication | Identity-based authentication
|---|:----:|:---:|
Azure Blob Container| ✓ | ✓|
Azure File Share| ✓ | |
Azure Data Lake Gen1 | ✓ | ✓|
Azure Data Lake Gen2| ✓ | ✓|
Azure SQL Database | ✓ | ✓|
Azure Database for PostgreSQL | ✓ | |
Databricks File System| ✓ | |
Azure Database for MySQL | ✓ | |


## Work with data

You can read in data from a datastore or directly from storage uri's. 

In Azure Machine Learning there are three types for data

Data type | Description | Example
---|------|---
`uri_file` | Refers to a specific file | `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/path/file.csv`.
`uri_folder`| Refers to a specific folder |`https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/path`
`mltable` |Defines tabular data for use in automated ML and parallel jobs| Schema and subsetting transforms

In the following example, the expectation is to provide a `uri_folder` because to read the file in, the training script creates a path that joins the folder with the file name. If you want to pass in just an individual file rather than the entire folder you can use the `uri_file` type.

```python
 file_name = os.path.join(args.input_folder, "MY_CSV_FILE.csv") 
df = pd.read_csv(file_name)
```

## Label data with data labeling projects

Labeling large amounts of data has often been a headache in machine learning projects. Those with a computer vision component, such as image classification or object detection, generally require thousands of images and corresponding labels.

Azure Machine Learning gives you a central location to create, manage, and monitor labeling projects. Labeling projects help coordinate the data, labels, and team members, allowing you to more efficiently manage the labeling tasks. Currently supported tasks are image classification, either multi-label or multi-class, and object identification using bounded boxes.

Create an [image labeling project](how-to-create-image-labeling-projects.md) or [text labeling project](how-to-create-text-labeling-projects.md), and output a dataset for use in machine learning experiments.
