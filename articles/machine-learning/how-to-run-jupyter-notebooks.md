# How to run Jupyter Notebooks in your workspace
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

Learn how to run your Jupyter Notebooks directly in your workspace in Azure Machine Learning studio. You can launch [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) to run your notebooks.  But now you can also create, edit, and run in the workspace without leaving studio.

See how you can:

* Create Jupyter Notebooks in your workspace
* Run an experiment from a notebook
* Change the notebook environment
* Find details of the compute instances used to run your notebooks

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.
* A Machine Learning workspace. See [Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace](how-to-manage-workspace.md).

## Create notebooks

### Clone samples

Your workspace contains a **Samples** folder with notebooks designed to help you explore the SDK and serve as models for your own machine learning projects.  You can clone these notebooks into your own folder on your workspace's storage container.  

For an example, see [Tutorial: Create your first ML experiment](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md#azure).

### Use files from Git and version my files

### Start from scratch?  Is this possible?

## Run an experiment

### Create compute

### View logs and output

## Change the notebook environment

### Stop and start a kernel

### Switch compute

### Switch to Jupyter/JupyterLab

### Switch pages in the notebook

## Find compute details
