# Secure an Azure Machine Learning workspace with virtual networks
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

In this article, you learn how to secure an Azure Machine Learning workspace and its associated resouces in a virtual network.


This article is part-two of a four-part series that walks you through securing a virtual network. See the other articles in this series:

[1. VNet overview](how-to-network-security-overview.md) > **2. Secure the workspace** > [3. Secure the training environment](how-to-secure-training-vnet.md) > [4. Secure the inferencing environment](how-to-secure-inferencing-vnet.md) 



In this article you learn how to configure the following workspaces resources to work in a virtual network:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Azure Machine Learning workspace
> - Azure Storage accounts
> - Azure Machine Learning datastores and datasets
> - Azure Key Vault
> - Azure Container Registry
> - Azure Container Instances

## Prerequisites

+ Read the [Network security overview](how-to-network-security-overview.md) article to understand common virtual network scenarios and overall virtual network architecture.

+ An existing virtual network and subnet to use with your compute resources.

+ To deploy resources into a virtual network or subnet, your user account must have permissions to the following actions in Azure role-based access controls (RBAC):

    - "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/join/action" on the virtual network resource.
    - "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnet/join/action" on the subnet resource.

    For more information on RBAC with networking, see the [Networking built-in roles](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#networking)


## Secure the workspace with private endpoint


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Azure Private Link with Azure Machine Learning workspace is currently in public preview. This functionality is only available in the **US East** and **US West 2** regions. 
> This preview is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities. 
> For more information, see [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/).

Azure Private Link enables you to connect to your workspace using a private endpoint. The private endpoint is a set of private IP addresses within your virtual network. You can then limit access to your workspace to only occur over the private IP addresses. Private Link helps reduce the risk of data exfiltration. To learn more about private endpoints, see the [Azure Private Link](/azure/private-link/private-link-overview) article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Private Link does not effect Azure control plane (management operations) such as deleting the workspace or managing compute resources. For example, creating, updating, or deleting a compute target. These operations are performed over the public Internet as normal.
>
> Azure Machine Learning compute instances preview is not supported in a workspace where Private Link is enabled.
>
> You may encounter problems trying to access the private endpoint for your workspace if you are using Mozilla Firefox. This problem may be related to DNS over HTTPS in Mozilla. We recommend using Microsoft Edge of Google Chrome as a workaround.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, we only support enabling a private endpoint when creating a new Azure Machine Learning workspace.

The template at [https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-machine-learning-advanced](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/201-machine-learning-advanced) can be used to create a workspace with a private endpoint.

For information on using this template, including private endpoints, see [Use an Azure Resource Manager template to create a workspace for Azure Machine Learning](how-to-create-workspace-template.md).

## Using a workspace over a private endpoint

Since communication to the workspace is only allowed from the virtual network, any development environments that use the workspace must be members of the virtual network. For example, a virtual machine in the virtual network.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To avoid temporary disruption of connectivity, Microsoft recommends flushing the DNS cache on machines connecting to the workspace after enabling Private Link. 

For information on Azure Virtual Machines, see the [Virtual Machines documentation](/azure/virtual-machines/).


> [!TIP]
> You can combine virtual network and Private Link together to protect communication between your workspace and other Azure resources. However, some combinations require an Enterprise edition workspace. Use the following table to understand what scenarios require Enterprise edition:
>
> | Scenario | Enterprise</br>edition | Basic</br>edition |
> | ----- |:-----:|:-----:| 
> | No virtual network or Private Link | ✔ | ✔ |
> | Workspace without Private Link. Other resources (except Azure Container Registry) in a virtual network | ✔ | ✔ |
> | Workspace without Private Link. Other resources with Private Link | ✔ | |
> | Workspace with Private Link. Other resources (except Azure Container Registry) in a virtual network | ✔ | ✔ |
> | Workspace and any other resource with Private Link | ✔ | |
> | Workspace with Private Link. Other resources without Private Link or virtual network | ✔ | ✔ |
> | Azure Container Registry in a virtual network | ✔ | |
> | Customer Managed Keys for workspace | ✔ | |

## Secure Azure storage accounts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can place the both the _default storage account_ for Azure Machine Learning, or _non-default storage accounts_ in a virtual network.
>
> The default storage account is
> automatically provisioned when you create a workspace.
>
> For non-default storage accounts, the `storage_account` parameter in the [`Workspace.create()` function](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace(class)?view=azure-ml-py#create-name--auth-none--subscription-id-none--resource-group-none--location-none--create-resource-group-true--sku--basic---friendly-name-none--storage-account-none--key-vault-none--app-insights-none--container-registry-none--cmk-keyvault-none--resource-cmk-uri-none--hbi-workspace-false--default-cpu-compute-target-none--default-gpu-compute-target-none--exist-ok-false--show-output-true-) allows you to specify a custom storage account by Azure resource ID.

To use an Azure storage service for the workspace in a virtual network, use the following steps:

1. Create a compute resource (for example, a Machine Learning compute instance or cluster) behind a virtual network, or attach a compute resource to the workspace (for example, an HDInsight cluster, virtual machine, or Azure Kubernetes Service cluster). The compute resource can be for experimentation or model deployment.

   For more information, see the [Use a Machine Learning compute](#amlcompute), [Use a virtual machine or HDInsight cluster](#vmorhdi), and [Use Azure Kubernetes Service](#aksvnet) sections in this article.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the storage service you want to use in your workspace.

   [![The storage that's attached to the Azure Machine Learning workspace](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/workspace-storage.png)](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/workspace-storage.png#lightbox)

1. On the storage service account page, select __Firewalls and virtual networks__.

   ![The "Firewalls and virtual networks" area on the Azure Storage page in the Azure portal](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/storage-firewalls-and-virtual-networks.png)

1. On the __Firewalls and virtual networks__ page, do the following actions:
    - Select __Selected networks__.
    - Under __Virtual networks__, select the __Add existing virtual network__ link. This action adds the virtual network where your compute resides (see step 1).

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > The storage account must be in the same virtual network and subnet as the compute instances or clusters used for training or inference.

    - Select the __Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account__ check box.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When working with the Azure Machine Learning SDK, your development environment must be able to connect to the Azure Storage Account. When the storage account is inside a virtual network, the firewall must allow access from the development environment's IP address.
    >
    > To enable access to the storage account, visit the __Firewalls and virtual networks__ for the storage account *from a web browser on the development client*. Then use the __Add your client IP address__ check box to add the client's IP address to the __ADDRESS RANGE__. You can also use the __ADDRESS RANGE__ field to manually enter the IP address of the development environment. Once the IP address for the client has been added, it can access the storage account using the SDK.

## Secure datastores and datasets

This section covers datastore and dataset usage for the SDK experience. For more information on the studio experience, see [Use Azure Machine Learning studio in a virtual network](how-to-enable-virtual-network-studio.md).

By default, Azure Machine Learning performs data validity and credential checks when you attempt to access data using the SDK. If your data is behind a virtual network, Azure Machine Learning can't access the data and fails its checks. To avoid this, you must create datastores and datasets that skip validation.

### Use datastores

 Azure Data Lake Store Gen1 and Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 skip validation by default, so no further action is necessary. However, for the following services you can use similar syntax to skip datastore validation:

- Azure Blob storage
- Azure fileshare
- PostgreSQL
- Azure SQL Database

The following code sample creates a new Azure Blob datastore and sets `skip_validation=True`.

```python
blob_datastore = Datastore.register_azure_blob_container(workspace=ws,  

                                                         datastore_name=blob_datastore_name,  

                                                         container_name=container_name,  

                                                         account_name=account_name, 

                                                         account_key=account_key, 

                                                         skip_validation=True ) // Set skip_validation to true
```

### Use datasets

The syntax to skip dataset validation is similar for the following dataset types:
- Delimited file
- JSON 
- Parquet
- SQL
- File

The following code creates a new JSON dataset and sets `validate=False`.

```python
json_ds = Dataset.Tabular.from_json_lines_files(path=datastore_paths, 

validate=False) 

```

## Secure Azure Key Vault 

Azure Machine Learning uses an associated Key Vault instance to store the following credentials:
* The associated storage account connection string
* Passwords to Azure Container Repository instances
* Connection strings to data stores

To use Azure Machine Learning experimentation capabilities with Azure Key Vault behind a virtual network, use the following steps:

1. Go to the Key Vault that's associated with the workspace.

   [![The key vault that's associated with the Azure Machine Learning workspace](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/workspace-key-vault.png)](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/workspace-key-vault.png#lightbox)

1. On the __Key Vault__ page, in the left pane, select __Firewalls and virtual networks__.

   ![The "Firewalls and virtual networks" section in the Key Vault pane](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/key-vault-firewalls-and-virtual-networks.png)

1. On the __Firewalls and virtual networks__ page, do the following actions:
    - Under __Allow access from__, select __Selected networks__.
    - Under __Virtual networks__, select __Add existing virtual networks__ to add the virtual network where your experimentation compute resides.
    - Under __Allow trusted Microsoft services to bypass this firewall__, select __Yes__.

   [![The "Firewalls and virtual networks" section in the Key Vault pane](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/key-vault-firewalls-and-virtual-networks-page.png)](./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/key-vault-firewalls-and-virtual-networks-page.png#lightbox)



## Enable Azure Container Registry (ACR)

To use Azure Container Registry inside a virtual network, you must meet the following requirements:

* Your Azure Machine Learning workspace must be Enterprise edition. For information on upgrading, see [Upgrade to Enterprise edition](how-to-manage-workspace.md#upgrade).

* Your Azure Machine Learning workspace region should be [privated link enabled region](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-link-overview#availability). 

* Your Azure Container Registry must be Premium version . For more information on upgrading, see [Changing SKUs](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus#changing-skus).

* Your Azure Container Registry must be in the same virtual network and subnet as the storage account and compute targets used for training or inference.

* Your Azure Machine Learning workspace must contain an [Azure Machine Learning compute cluster](how-to-set-up-training-targets.md#amlcompute).

    When ACR is behind a virtual network, Azure Machine Learning cannot use it to directly build Docker images. Instead, the compute cluster is used to build the images.

Once those requirements are fulfilled, use the following steps to enable Azure Container Registry.

1. Find the name of the Azure Container Registry for your workspace, using one of the following methods:

    __Azure portal__

    From the overview section of your workspace, the __Registry__ value links to the Azure Container Registry.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-enable-virtual-network/azure-machine-learning-container-registry.png" alt-text="Azure Container Registry for the workspace" border="true":::

    __Azure CLI__

    If you have [installed the Machine Learning extension for Azure CLI](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md), you can use the `az ml workspace show` command to show the workspace information.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ml workspace show -w yourworkspacename -g resourcegroupname --query 'containerRegistry'
    ```

    This command returns a value similar to `"/subscriptions/{GUID}/resourceGroups/{resourcegroupname}/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/{ACRname}"`. The last part of the string is the name of the Azure Container Registry for the workspace.

1. Limit access to your virtual network using the steps in [Configure network access for registry](../container-registry/container-registry-vnet.md#configure-network-access-for-registry). When adding the virtual network, select the virtual network and subnet for your Azure Machine Learning resources.

1. Use the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK to configure a compute cluster to build docker images. The following code snippet demonstrates how to do this:

    ```python
    from azureml.core import Workspace
    # Load workspace from an existing config file
    ws = Workspace.from_config()
    # Update the workspace to use an existing compute cluster
    ws.update(image_build_compute = 'mycomputecluster')
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Your storage account, compute cluster, and Azure Container Registry must all be in the same subnet of the virtual network.
    
    For more information, see the [update()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace.workspace?view=azure-ml-py#update-friendly-name-none--description-none--tags-none--image-build-compute-none--enable-data-actions-none-) method reference.

1. You must apply the following Azure Resource Manager template. This template enables your workspace to communicate with ACR.

    ```json
    {
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "keyVaultArmId": {
        "type": "string"
        },
        "workspaceName": {
        "type": "string"
        },
        "containerRegistryArmId": {
        "type": "string"
        },
        "applicationInsightsArmId": {
        "type": "string"
        },
        "storageAccountArmId": {
        "type": "string"
        },

        "type": "string"
        }
    },

        {
        "type": "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces",
        "apiVersion": "2019-11-01",
        "name": "[parameters('workspaceName')]",
        "location": "[parameters('location')]",
        "identity": {
            "type": "SystemAssigned"
        },
        "sku": {
            "tier": "enterprise",
            "name": "enterprise"
        },
        "properties": {
            "sharedPrivateLinkResources":
    [{"Name":"Acr","Properties":{"PrivateLinkResourceId":"[concat(parameters('containerRegistryArmId'), '/privateLinkResources/registry')]","GroupId":"registry","RequestMessage":"Approve","Status":"Pending"}}],
            "keyVault": "[parameters('keyVaultArmId')]",
            "containerRegistry": "[parameters('containerRegistryArmId')]",
            "applicationInsights": "[parameters('applicationInsightsArmId')]",
            "storageAccount": "[parameters('storageAccountArmId')]"
        }
        }
    ]
    }
    ```


## Enable Azure Container Instances (ACI)

Azure Container Instances are dynamically created when deploying a model. To enable Azure Machine Learning to create ACI inside the virtual network, you must enable __subnet delegation__ for the subnet used by the deployment.

> [!WARNING]
> When using Azure Container Instances in a virtual network, the virtual network must be in the same resource group as your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
>
> When using Azure Container Instances inside the virtual network, the Azure Container Registry (ACR) for your workspace cannot also be in the virtual network.

To use ACI in a virtual network to your workspace, use the following steps:

1. To enable subnet delegation on your virtual network, use the information in the [Add or remove a subnet delegation](../virtual-network/manage-subnet-delegation.md) article. You can enable delegation when creating a virtual network, or add it to an existing network.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When enabling delegation, use `Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups` as the __Delegate subnet to service__ value.

2. Deploy the model using [AciWebservice.deploy_configuration()](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.aci.aciwebservice?view=azure-ml-py#deploy-configuration-cpu-cores-none--memory-gb-none--tags-none--properties-none--description-none--location-none--auth-enabled-none--ssl-enabled-none--enable-app-insights-none--ssl-cert-pem-file-none--ssl-key-pem-file-none--ssl-cname-none--dns-name-label-none--primary-key-none--secondary-key-none--collect-model-data-none--cmk-vault-base-url-none--cmk-key-name-none--cmk-key-version-none--vnet-name-none--subnet-name-none-), use the `vnet_name` and `subnet_name` parameters. Set these parameters to the virtual network name and subnet where you enabled delegation.
