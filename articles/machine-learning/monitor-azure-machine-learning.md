<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Machine Learning with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace machine-learning with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_07
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on this template)
   - Title: "Monitor Machine Learning"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-machine-learning.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on the template data-reference-template.md).
   - Title: "Machine Learning monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-machine-learning-reference.md".

<!-- ANALYSIS SECTION START -------------------------------------->

<a id="analyzing-log-data"></a>
<!-- ## Analyze data. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-analyze-data](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-analyze-data.md)]

<!-- ### External tools. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-external-tools](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-external-tools.md)]

[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-kusto-queries](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-kusto-queries.md)]
<!-- Add sample Kusto queries for your service here. -->
You can use the following queries to help you monitor your Machine Learning resources: 

+ Get failed jobs in the last five days:

    ```Kusto
    AmlComputeJobEvent
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(5d) and EventType == "JobFailed"
    | project  TimeGenerated , ClusterId , EventType , ExecutionState , ToolType
    ```

+ Get records for a specific job name:

    ```Kusto
    AmlComputeJobEvent
    | where JobName == "automl_a9940991-dedb-4262-9763-2fd08b79d8fb_setup"
    | project  TimeGenerated , ClusterId , EventType , ExecutionState , ToolType
    ```

+ Get cluster events in the last five days for clusters where the VM size is Standard_D1_V2:

    ```Kusto
    AmlComputeClusterEvent
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(4d) and VmSize == "STANDARD_D1_V2"
    | project  ClusterName , InitialNodeCount , MaximumNodeCount , QuotaAllocated , QuotaUtilized
    ```

+ Get the cluster node allocations in the last eight days::

    ```Kusto
    AmlComputeClusterEvent
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(8d) and TargetNodeCount  > CurrentNodeCount
    | project TimeGenerated, ClusterName, CurrentNodeCount, TargetNodeCount
    ```

When you connect multiple Machine Learning workspaces to the same Log Analytics workspace, you can query across all resources. 

+ Get number of running nodes across workspaces and clusters in the last day:

    ```Kusto
    AmlComputeClusterEvent
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(1d)
    | summarize avgRunningNodes=avg(TargetNodeCount), maxRunningNodes=max(TargetNodeCount)
             by Workspace=tostring(split(_ResourceId, "/")[8]), ClusterName, ClusterType, VmSize, VmPriority
    ```

<!-- ### Machine Learning service-specific analytics. Optional section.
Add short information or links to specific articles that outline how to analyze data for your service. -->

<!-- ANALYSIS SECTION END ------------------------------------->

<!-- ALERTS SECTION START -------------------------------------->

<!-- ## Alerts. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-alerts](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-alerts.md)]

<!-- ONLY if applications run on your service that work with Application Insights, add the following include. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-insights-alerts](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-insights-alerts.md)]

<!-- ### Machine Learning alert rules. Required section.
**MUST HAVE** service-specific alert rules. Include useful alerts on metrics, logs, log conditions, or activity log.
Fill in the following table with metric and log alerts that would be valuable for your service. Change the format as necessary for readability. You can instead link to an article that discusses your common alerts in detail.
Ask your PMs if you don't know. This information is the BIGGEST request we get in Azure Monitor, so don't avoid it long term. People don't know what to monitor for best results. Be prescriptive. -->

### Machine Learning alert rules
The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Machine Learning.

| Alert type | Condition | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Model Deploy Failed | Aggregation type: Total, Operator: Greater than, Threshold value: 0 | When one or more model deployments have failed |
| Quota Utilization Percentage | Aggregation type: Average, Operator: Greater than, Threshold value: 90| When the quota utilization percentage is greater than 90% |
| Unusable Nodes | Aggregation type: Total, Operator: Greater than, Threshold value: 0 | When there are one or more unusable nodes |

<!-- ### Advisor recommendations. Required section. -->
[!INCLUDE [horz-monitor-advisor-recommendations](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-monitor/horizontals/horz-monitor-advisor-recommendations.md)]
