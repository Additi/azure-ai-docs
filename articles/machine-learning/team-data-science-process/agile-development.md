# Agile development of data science projects

This document describes how developers can execute a data science project in a systematic, version controlled, and collaborative way within a project team by using the [Team Data Science Process](overview.md) (TDSP). The TDSP is a framework developed by Microsoft that provides a structured sequence of activities to efficiently execute cloud-based, predictive analytics solutions. For an outline of the roles and tasks that are handled by a data science team standardizing on the TDSP, see [Team Data Science Process roles and tasks](roles-tasks.md). 

This article includes instructions on how to: 

- Do *sprint planning* for work items involved in a project.
- Add *work items* to sprints.
- Create and use an *agile-derived work item template* that specifically aligns with TDSP lifecycle stages.

The following instructions outline the steps needed to set up a TDSP team environment using Azure Boards and Azure Repos in Azure DevOps. The instructions use Azure DevOps because that is how to implement TDSP at Microsoft. If your group uses a different code hosting platform, the team lead tasks generally don't change, but the way to complete the tasks is different. For example, linking a work item with a Git branch might not be as easy with GitHub as it is with Azure Repos.

The following figure illustrates a typical sprint planning, coding, and source-control workflow for a data science project:

##  <a name='Terminology-1'></a>Work item types

In the TDSP sprint planning framework, there are four frequently used *work item* types: *Features*, *User Stories*, *Tasks*, and *Bugs*. The backlog for all work items is at the project level, not the Git repository level. 

Here are the definitions for the work item types:

- **Feature**: A feature corresponds to a project engagement. Different engagements with a client are different features, and it's best to consider different phases of a project as different features. If you choose a schema such as *\<ClientName>-\<EngagementName>* to name your features, you can easily recognize the context of the project and engagement from the names themselves.
  
- **User Story**: User Stories are work items needed to complete a Feature end-to-end. Examples of User Stories include:
  - Get data 
  - Explore data 
  - Generate features
  - Build models
  - Operationalize models 
  - Retrain models
  
- **Task**: Tasks are assignable work items that need to be done to complete a specific User Story. For example, Tasks in the User Story *Get data* could be:
  - Get SQL Server credentials
  - Upload data to SQL Data Warehouse
  
- **Bug**: Bugs are fixes for existing code or documents that are done when completing a Task. If Bugs are caused by missing stages or tasks, they can escalate to being User Stories or Tasks. 

Data scientists may feel more comfortable using an agile template that replaces Features, User Stories, and Tasks with TDSP lifecycle stages and substages. To create an agile-derived template that specifically aligns with the TDSP lifecycle stages, see [Set up an agile TDSP work template](#set-up-agile-dsp-6).

> [!NOTE]
> TDSP borrows the concepts of Features, User Stories, Tasks, and Bugs from software code management (SCM). The TDSP concepts might differ slightly from their conventional SCM definitions.

## <a name='SprintPlanning-2'></a>Sprint planning

Many data scientists are engaged with multiple projects, which can proceed at different paces and take months to complete. Sprint planning is useful for project prioritization, and resource planning and allocation. In Azure Boards, you can easily create, manage, and track work items for your project, and conduct sprint planning to ensure that your projects are moving forward as expected. 

For more information about sprint planning, see [Scrum sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint). 

For more information about sprint planning in Azure Boards, see [Assign backlog items to a sprint](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/assign-work-sprint). 

## <a name='AddFeature-3'></a>Add a Feature to a project 

Add a Feature to represent the work for your project.

1. From your project page, select **Boards** in the left navigation. 
   
1. On the **Work items** page, select the dropdown arrow next to **New Work Item**, and select **Feature** from the dropdown. 
   
   ![Select Feature from New Work Item](./media/agile-development/2-sprint-team-overview.png)
   
1. Enter a title for the Feature, usually your project name, and then select **Save**. 
   
   ![Enter a title and select Save](./media/agile-development/3-sprint-team-add-work.png)
   
1. In the new Feature, fill in descriptions, assign a team member, and set planning parameters. 
   
   You can also link the Feature to the project's Azure Repos repository by selecting **Add link** under the **Development** section. 
   
   After you have finished editing the feature, select **Save & Close**.
   
   ![Add link to Azure Repo and select Save & Close](./media/agile-development/3a-add-link-repo.png)

## <a name='AddStoryunderfeature-4'></a>Add a User Story to the Feature 

Under the Feature, you can add User Stories to describe major steps needed to finish the project. 

To add a new User Story to a Feature:

1. On the **Backlog** tab, select the **+** to the left of the Feature, and then select **User Story** from the popup menu.  
   
   ![Add a new User Story under the Feature](./media/agile-development/4-sprint-add-story.png)
   
1. Give the User Story a title, and edit details such as assignment, status, description, comments, planning, and priority. 
   
   You can also link the User Story to a branch of the project's Azure Repos repository by selecting **Add link** under the **Development** section. Select the repository and branch you want to link the work item to, and then select **OK**.
   
   ![Add link](./media/agile-development/5-sprint-edit-story.png)
   
1. When you're finished editing the User Story, select **Save & Close**. 

## <a name='AddTaskunderstory-5'></a>Add a Task to a User Story 

Tasks are specific detailed steps that are needed to complete each User Story. After all Tasks of a User Story are completed, the User Story should be completed too. 

To add a Task to a User Story, select the **+** next to the User Story item, and then fill in the detailed information in the Task.

![Add a Task to a User Story](./media/agile-development/7-sprint-add-task.png)

After you create Features, User Stories, and Tasks, you can view them in the **Backlogs** or **Boards** views to track their status.

## <a name='set-up-agile-dsp-6'></a>Set up and use an agile TDSP work template

Data scientists may feel more comfortable using an agile template that replaces Features, User Stories, and Tasks with TDSP lifecycle stages and substages. In Azure Boards, you can create an agile-derived template that uses  TDSP lifecycle stages to create and track work items. The following steps walk through setting up a data science-specific agile process template and creating data science work items based on the template.

### Set up the agile data science process template

1. From your Azure DevOps organization main page, select **Organization settings** from the left navigation. 
   
1. In the **Organization Settings** left navigation, select **Boards** > **Process**. 
   
1. In the **All processes** pane, select the **...** next to **Agile**, and then select **Create inherited process**.
   
   ![Create inherited process from Agile](./media/agile-development/10-settings.png) 
   
1. In the **Create inherited process from Agile** dialog, enter the name *AgileDataScienceProcess*, and select **Create process**.
   
   ![Create AgileDataScienceProcess process](./media/agile-development/11-agileds.png)
   
1. In **All processes**, select the new **AgileDataScienceProcess**. 
   
1. On the **Work item types** tab, disable **Epic**, **Feature**, **User Story**, and **Task** by selecting the **...** next to each item and then selecting **Disable**. 
   
   ![Disable work item types](./media/agile-development/12-disable.png)
   
1. Select the **Backlog levels** tab. Under **Portfolios backlogs**, select the **...** next to **Epic (disabled)**, and then select **Edit/Rename**. 
   
1. In the **Edit backlog level** dialog box:
   1. Under **Name**, replace **Epic** with *TDSP Projects*. 
   1. Under **Work item types on this backlog level**, select **New work item type**, enter *TDSP Project*, and select **Add**. 
   1. Under **Default work item type**, drop down and select **TDSP Project**. 
   1. Select **Save**.
   
   ![Set Portfolio backlog level](./media/agile-development/13-rename.png)  
   
1. Follow the same steps to rename **Features** to *TDSP Stages*, and add the following new work item types:
   
   - Business Understanding
   - Data Acquisition
   - Modeling
   - Deployment
   
1. Under **Requirement backlog**, rename **Stories** to *TDSP Substages*, add the new work item type *TDSP Substage*, and set the default work item type to **TDSP Substage**.
   
1. Under **Iteration backlog**, add a new work item type *TDSP Task*, and set it to be the default work item type. 
   
After you complete the steps, the backlog levels should look like this:
   
 ![TDSP template backlog levels](./media/agile-development/14-template.png)  

### Create Data Science work items

You can use the data science process template to create TDSP projects and track work items that correspond to TDSP lifecycle stages.

1. From your Azure DevOps organization main page, select **New project**. 
   
1. In the **Create new project** dialog, give your project a name, and then select **Advanced**. 
   
1. Under **Work item process**, drop down and select **AgileDataScienceProcess**, and then select **Create**.
   
   ![Create a TDSP project](./media/agile-development/15-newproject.png)
   
1. In the newly created project, select **Boards** > **Backlogs** in the left navigation.
   
1. To make TDSP Projects visible, select the **Configure team settings** icon. In the **Settings** screen, select the **TDSP Projects** check box, and then select **Save and close**.
   
   ![Select TDSP Projects check box](./media/agile-development/16-enabledsprojects1.png)
   
1. To create data science-specific work items, select **TDSP Projects** in the top bar, and then select **New work item**. 
   
1. In the popup, give the TDSP Project work item a name, and select **Add to top**.
   
   ![Create data science project work item](./media/agile-development/17-dsworkitems0.png)
   
1. Select the **+** next to the new project, and then select the type of work item to create. 
   
   ![Select data science work item type](./media/agile-development/17-dsworkitems1.png)
   
1. Fill in the details in the new work item.
   
1. Continue to select the **+** symbols next to work items to add new TDSP Stages, Substages, and Tasks. 
   
Here is an example of how the data science project work items should appear in Backlog view:
