# Predict Twitter sentiment from work embeddings

This article shows how to collaborate effectively when using the **Word2Vec** word embedding algorithm and the **Sentiment Specific Word Embedding (SSWE) Algorithm** to predict Twitter sentiment with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. The key to facilitating effective team collaboration on data science projects is to standardize the structure and documentation of the projects with an established data science lifecycle. The [Team Data Science Process (TDSP)](overview.md) provides just such a structured [lifecycle](lifecycle.md). Creating data science projects with the TDSP template provides this standardized framework for Azure Machine Learning projects.

Previously, the TDSP team had released a [GitHub repository for the TDSP project structure and templates](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-TDSP-ProjectTemplate). Now the creation of Azure Machine Learning projects that are instantiated with [TDSP structure and documentation templates for Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/amlsamples/tdsp) has been enabled. For instructions on how to use TDSP structure and templates in Azure Machine Learning, see [Structure projects with the Team Data Science Process template](how-to-use-tdsp-in-azure-ml.md). 


## Link to GitHub repository
A [walkthrough](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/blob/master/docs/deliverable_docs/Step_By_Step_Tutorial.md) has been provided in GitHub repository.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of this sample is to show how to instantiate and execute a machine learning project using the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) structure and templates in Azure Machine Learning Work Bench. For this purpose, [Twitter Sentiment data](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/trainingandtestdata.zip) is used. The modeling task is to predict sentiment polarity (positive or negative) using the text from tweets.

### Scope
- Data exploration, training, and deployment of a machine learning model which address the prediction problem described in the Use Case Overview.
- Execution of the project in Azure Machine Learning using the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) template from Azure Machine Learning for this project. For project execution and reporting, we're going to use the TDSP lifecycle.
- Operationalization of the solution directly from Azure Machine Learning in Azure Container Services.

The project highlights several features of Azure Machine Learning, such TDSP structure instantiation and use, execution of code in Azure Machine Learning Work Bench, and easy operationalization in Azure Container Services using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Team Data Science Process
You use the TDSP project structure and documentation templates to execute this sample. It follows the [TDSP lifecycle]((https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft-TDSP/blob/master/Docs/lifecycle-detail.md)). The project is created based on the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/amlsamples/tdsp/blob/master/docs/how-to-use-tdsp-in-azure-ml.md).

## Use case overview
The task is to predict each twitter's sentiment binary polarity using word embeddings features extracted from twitter text. For detailed description, refer to this [repository](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction).


## [Data acquisition and understanding](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/01_data_acquisition_and_understanding)
The first step in this sample is to download the sentiment140 dataset and divide it into train and test datasets. Sentiment140 dataset contains the actual content of the tweet (with emoticons removed) along with the polarity of each of the tweet (negative=0, positive=4) as well, with neutral tweets removed. The resulting training data has 1.3 million rows and testing data has 320k rows.


## [Modeling](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/02_modeling)
This part of the sample is further divided into three subparts: 
- **Feature Engineering** corresponds to the generation of features using different word embedding algorithms. 
- **Model Creation** deals with the training of different models like _logistic regression_ and _gradient boosting_ to predict sentiment of the input text. 
- **Model Evaluation** applies the trained model over the testing data.


### [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/02_modeling/01_FeatureEngineering)
You use Word2Vec and SSWE to generate word embeddings. 


#### Word2Vec
First you use the Word2Vec algorithm in the Skipgram mode as explained in the paper [Mikolov, Tomas, et al. Distributed representations of words ancompositionalityd phrases and their compositionality. Advances in neural information processing systems. 2013.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546) to generate word embeddings.

Skip-gram is a shallow neural network taking the target word encoded as a one hot vector as input and using it to predict nearby words. If _V_ is the size of the vocabulary, then the size of the output layer would be __C*V__ where C is the size of the context window. The skip-gram based architecture is shown in the following figure:

***Skip-gram model***

The details of the word2vec algorithm and skip-gram model are beyond the scope of this sample and the interested readers are requested to go through the following links for more details. The code 02_A_Word2Vec.py referenced [TensorFlow examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py)

* [Vector Representation of Words](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec)
* [How exactly does word2vec work?](http://www.1-4-5.net/~dmm/ml/how_does_word2vec_work.pdf)
* [Notes on Noise Contrastive Estimation and Negative Sampling](http://demo.clab.cs.cmu.edu/cdyer/nce_notes.pdf)


#### SSWE
**Sentiment Specific Word Embedding (SSWE) Algorithm** proposed in [Tang, Duyu, et al. "Learning Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding for Twitter Sentiment Classification." ACL (1). 2014.](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1146) tries to overcome the weakness of Word2vec algorithm that the words with similar contexts and opposite polarity can have similar word vectors. This similarity means that Word2vec may not perform accurately for the tasks like sentiment analysis. SSWE algorithm tries to handle this weakness by incorporating both the sentence polarity and the word's context in to its loss function.

You are using a variant of SSWE in this sample. SSWE uses both the original ngram and corrupted ngram as input and it uses a ranking style hinge loss function for both the syntactic loss and the semantic loss. Ultimate loss function is the weighted combination of both the syntactic loss and semantic loss. For the purpose of simplicity, only the semantic cross entropy is used as the loss function. As you see later on, even with this simpler loss function the performance of the SSWE embedding is better than the Word2Vec embedding.

The SSWE inspired neural network model that you use in this sample is shown in the following figure:

After the training process is done, two embedding files in the TSV format are generated for the modeling stage.

For more information about Word2Vec and SSWE, you can refer to those papers: [Mikolov, Tomas, et al. Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality. Advances in neural information processing systems. 2013.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546) and **Sentiment Specific Word Embedding (SSWE) Algorithm** [Tang, Duyu, et al. "Learning Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding for Twitter Sentiment Classification." ACL (1). 2014.](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P14-1146) 


### [Model Creation](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/02_modeling/02_ModelCreation)
Once the word vectors have been generated using either of the SSWE or Word2vec algorithm, the next step is to train the classification models to predict actual sentiment polarity. Two types of features, Word2Vec and SSWE, are being applied to two models: the GBM model and Logistic regression model. So  four models are being trained.


### [Model Evaluation](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/02_modeling/03_ModelEvaluation)
Now you use the four models trained in previous step in testing data to evaluate the model's performance, GBM model with SSWE features is the best one in terms of AUC value.

1. Gradient Boosting over SSWE embedding
2. Logistic Regression over SSWE embedding
3. Gradient Boosting over Word2Vec embedding
4. Logistic Regression over Word2Vec embedding

## [Deployment](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningSamples-TwitterSentimentPrediction/tree/master/code/03_deployment)
This part deploy deploy pre-trained sentiment prediction model (SSWE embedding + GBM model) to a web service on a cluster in the Azure Container Service (ACS). The operationalization environment provisions Docker and Kubernetes in the cluster to manage the web-service deployment. You can find further information on the operationalization process [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/model-management-service-deploy).

## Conclusion

The details on how to train a word-embedding model using the Word2Vec and SSWE algorithms were explained and then the extracted embeddings were used as features to train several models to predict the sentiment score of Twitter text data. Sentiment Specific Wording Embeddings(SSWE) feature with Gradient Boosted Tree model gives the best performance. This model was then deployed as a real-time web service in Azure Container Services with the help of Azure Machine Learning Work Bench.
