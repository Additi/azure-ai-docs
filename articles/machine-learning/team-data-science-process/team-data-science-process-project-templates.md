# Team Data Science Process project templates

The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) provides a lifecycle to structure the development of your data science projects. The lifecycle outlines the major stages that projects typically execute, often iteratively:

- Business Understanding
- Data Acquisition and Understanding
- Modeling
- Deployment
- Customer Acceptance

For descriptions of each of these stages, see [The Team Data Science Process lifecycle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle).

This article provides links to Microsoft Project and Excel templates that help you plan and manage these project stages. 

## Microsoft Project template

The Microsoft Project template for the Team Data Science Process is available from here: [Microsoft Project template](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Team-Data-Science-Process/Project-Planning-and-Governance/Advanced%20Analytics%20Microsoft%20Project%20Plan.mpp) 

When you open the plan, click the link to the far left for the TDSP. Change the name and description and then add in any other team resources you need. The dates need to be estimated from your experience.

Each task has a note. Open those tasks to see what resources have already been created for you.

## Excel template

If donâ€™t have access to Microsoft Project, an Excel worksheet with all the same data is also available for download here: [Excel template](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/blob/master/Team-Data-Science-Process/Project-Planning-and-Governance/Advanced%20Analytics%20Microsoft%20Project%20Plan.xlsx)
You can pull it in to whatever tool you prefer to use.
