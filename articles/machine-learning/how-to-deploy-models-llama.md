# How to deploy Llama 2 family of large language models with Azure Machine Learning studio

(change - preview note)

The Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. The model family also includes fine-tuned versions optimized for dialogue use cases with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), called Llama-2-chat.

Llama 2 can be deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go billing or with hosted infrastructure in real-time endpoints.

## Deploy Llama 2 models with pay-as-you-go

Certain models in the model catalog can be deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go, providing a way to consume them as an API without hosting them on your subscription, while keeping the enterprise security and compliance organizations need. This deployment option doesn't require quota from your subscription.

Llama 2 models deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go are offered by Meta AI through the Azure Marketplace and they might add more terms of use and pricing.

> [!NOTE]
> Pay-as-you-go offering is only available in workspaces created in East US 2 and West US 3 regions.

### Offerings

The following models are available for Llama 2 when deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go:

* Meta Llama-2-7B (preview)
* Meta Llama 2 7B-Chat (preview)
* Meta Llama-2-13B (preview)
* Meta Llama 2 13B-Chat (preview)
* Meta Llama-2-70B (preview)
* Meta Llama 2 70B-Chat (preview)

If you need to deploy a different model, [deploy it to real-time endpoints](#deploy-llama-2-models-to-real-time-endpoints) instead.

### Create a new deployment

To create a deployment:

1.  Choose the workspace you want to deploy your models in
2.  Choose a model you want to deploy from the Azure Machine Learning Studio [model catalog](change - add link). Alternatively, you can initiate deployment by selecting **Create** from the **Endpoints** option under **Assets** in your workspace.
   
1. On the detail page, select **Deploy** and then **Pay-as-you-go**.
   (change - add image - Image 1 Select deploy and then Pay-as-you-go)
   
3. On the deployment wizard, you see the option to explore more terms and conditions applied to the selected model and its pricing. Select **Azure Marketplace Terms** to learn about it.
   (change - add image - Image 2 – terms and conditions, and subscribe)
   
5. If this is the first time you deployed the model in the workspace, you have to sign your workspace up for the particular offering from the Azure Marketplace. Each workspace has its own connection to the marketplace's offering, which, allows you to control and monitor spending per workspace. Select **Subscribe and Deploy**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > (change - update RBAC) Subscribing a workspace to a particular offering from the Azure Marketplace requires (change this) **Contributor** or **Owner** access at the subscription level where the workspace is created. 

1. Once you sign up the workspace for the offering, subsequent deployments don't require signing up (neither subscription-level permissions). If this is your case, select **Continue to deploy**.

    (change - add image - Image 3 – subsequent deployments don’t requiring re-subscribing)

1. Give the deployment a name. Such name is part of the deployment API URL, which requires to be unique on each Azure region.

    (change - add image - Image 4 deployment name):

1. Select **Deploy**.

1. Once the deployment is ready, you're redirected to the deployed serverless endpoints page.

1. Once your deployment is ready, you can select **Test** tab on the endpoint details page to start interacting with the model.

1. You can also take note of the **Target** URL and the **Secret Key** to call the deployment and generate completions.   

1. Additionally, you can find the deployment details, URL, and access keys by navigating to **Workspace** > **Endpoints** > **Serverless endpoints**.

### Consume Llama 2 models as a service

Models deployed as a service can be consumed using either the chat or the completions API, depending on the type of model you have deployed.

1. In the **workspace**, select **Endpoints** > **Serverless endpoints**.

1. Find and select the deployment you created.

1. Copy the **Target** URL and the **Key** token values.   

1. Make an API request depending on the type of model you deployed. For completions models such as `Llama-2-7b` use the [`<target_url>/v1/completions`](#completions-api) API, for chat models such as `Llama-2-7b-chat` use the [`<target_url>/v1/chat/completions`](#chat-api) API. See the [reference](#reference-for-llama-2-models-deployed-as-a-service) section for more details with examples.

### Reference for Llama 2 models deployed as a service

#### Completions API

Use the method `POST` to send the request to the `/v1/completions` route:

__Request__

```rest
POST /v1/completions HTTP/1.1
Host: <DEPLOYMENT_URI>
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
Content-type: application/json
```

#### Request schema

Payload is a JSON formatted string containing the following parameters:

| Key           | Type      | Default | Description    |
|---------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `prompt`      | `string`  |  No default. This must be specified.  | The prompt to send to the model. |
| `stream`      | `boolean` | `False`  | Streaming allows the generated tokens to be sent as data-only server-sent events whenever they become available. |
| `max_tokens`  | `integer` | `16`    | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion. The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` can't exceed the model's context length.  |
| `top_p`       | `float`   | `1`     | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with `top_p` probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering it or `temperature` but not both. |
| `temperature` | `float`   | `1`     | The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values mean the model samples more broadly the distribution of tokens. Zero means greedy sampling. It's recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. |
| `n`           | `integer` | `1`     | How many completions to generate for each prompt. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. |
| `stop`        | `array`   | `null`  | String or a list of strings containing the word where the API stops generating further tokens. The returned text won't contain the stop sequence.   |
| `best_of`     | `integer` | `1`     | Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the lowest log probability per token). Results can't be streamed. When used with n, best_of controls the number of candidate completions and n specifies how many to return – best_of must be greater than n. Note: Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota.|
| `logprobs` | `integer` |  `null` | A number indicating to include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 10, the API returns a list of the 10 most likely tokens. the API always returns the logprob of the sampled token, so there might be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.  |
| `presence_penalty`    | `float`   | `null`  | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. |
| `ignore_eos`          | `boolean` | `True`  | Whether to ignore the EOS token and continue generating tokens after the EOS token is generated.  |
| `use_beam_search`     | `boolean` | `False` | Whether to use beam search instead of sampling. In such case, `best_of must > 1` and `temperature` must be `0`. |
| `stop_token_ids`      | `array`   | `null`  | List of tokens' ID that stops the generation when they're generated. The returned output contains the stop tokens unless the stop tokens are special tokens. |
| `skip_special_tokens` | `boolean` | `null`  | Whether to skip special tokens in the output. |

#### Example

```json
{
    "prompt": "What's the distance to the moon?",
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "max_tokens": 512,
}

## Deploy Llama 2 models to real-time endpoints

Llama 2 models can be deployed to real-time endpoints in Azure Machine Learning studio. When deployed to real-time endpoints, you can select all the details about the infrastructure running the model including the virtual machines used to run it and the number of instances to handle the load you're expecting. Models deployed in this modality consume quota from your subscription. All the models in the Llama family can be deployed to real-time endpoints.

### Create a new deployment

# [Studio](#tab/azure-studio)

Follow the steps below to deploy a model such as `Llama-2-7b-chat` to a real-time endpoint in [Azure ML Studio](https://ml.azure.com).

1.  Choose the worspace you want to deploy the model in.
2.  Choose a model you want to deploy from the ML Studio [model catalog](change - add link). Alternatively, you can initiate deployment by selecting **Create** from `your workspace`>`endpoints`>`serverless endpoints`
3.  On the detail page, select **Deploy** and then **Real-time endpoint**.
4.  Select if you want to enable **Azure AI Content Safety (preview)**.

    > [!TIP]
    > Deploying Llama 2 models with Azure AI Content Safety (preview) is currently only supported using the Python SDK. (change - check)
5. Select **Proceed**. .

    > [!TIP]
    > If you don't have enough quota available in the selected project, you can use the option **I want to use shared quota and I acknowledge that this endpoint will be deleted in 168 hours**.
6. Select the **Virtual machine** and the instance count you want to assign to the deployment.

7. Select if you want to create this deployment as part of a new endpoint or an existing one. Endpoints can host multiple deployments while keeping resources configuration exclusive for each of them. Deployments under the same endpoint share the endpoint URI and its access keys.

8. Indicate if you want to enable **Inferencing data collection (preview)** or **Package Model (preview)**.
9. Select **Deploy**.
10. You land on the deployment details page. Select **Consume** to obtain code samples that can be used to consume the deployed model in your application. 

# [Python SDK](#tab/python) (change - check)

### Consuming Llama 2 models deployed to real-time endpoints

For reference about how to invoke Llama 2 models deployed to real-time endpoints, see the model card in the Azure Machine Learning Studio [model catalog](change - add link).

## Cost and quotas

### Considerations for Llama 2 models deployed as a service

Llama models deployed as a service are offered by Meta through the Azure Marketplace and integrated with Azure Machine Learning Studio for use. You can find the Azure Marketplace pricing when deploying or fine tuning models.

Each time a workspace subscribes to a given offer from the Azure Marketplace, a new resource is created to track the costs associated with its consumption. The same resource is used to track costs associated with inference and fine tuning, However, multiple meters are available to track each scenario independently. See (change - check link) [monitor costs for models offered throughout the Azure Marketplace](./costs-plan-manage.md#monitor-costs-for-models-offered-through-the-azure-marketplace) to learn more about how to track costs.

(change - use same image

:::image type="content" source="../media/cost-management/marketplace/costs-model-as-service-cost-details.png" alt-text="A screenshot showing different resources corresponding to different model offers and their associated meters."  lightbox="../media/cost-management/marketplace/costs-model-as-service-cost-details.png":::
)

Quota is managed per deployment. Each deployment has a rate limit of 200,000 tokens per minute and 1,000 API requests per minute. However, we currently limit one deployment per model per project. Contact Microsoft Azure Support if the current rate limits don’t suffice your scenarios.

### Considerations for Llama 2 models deployed as real-time endpoints

Deploying Llama models and inferencing with real-time endpoints can be done by consuming Virtual Machine (VM) core quota that is assigned to your subscription a per-region basis. When you sign up for Azure Machine Learning Studio, you receive a default VM quota for several VM families available in the region. You can continue to create deployments until you reach your quota limit. Once that happens, you can request for quota increase.  

## Content filtering

Models deployed as a service with pay-as-you-go are protected by Azure AI Content Safety. When deployed to real-time endpoints, you can opt out for this capability. Both the prompt and completion are run through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions.
