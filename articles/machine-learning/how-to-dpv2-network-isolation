# Network Isolation Change with Our New API Platform on Azure Resource Manager

In this article, you'll learn about network isolation changes with our new API platform on Azure Resource Manager (ARM). You'll also learn how to maintain network isolation.

## What is the New API platform on Azure Resource Manager (ARM)

Our legacy v1 API platform relied on two services which are ARM/Control Plane and Workspace/Data Plane. Workspace and Compute CRUD use ARM/Control Plane, and all other operations use Workspace/Data Plane. Our new v2 API platform uses only ARM/Control Plane. You can enjoy consistent API in one plance and ARM benefits such as granular RBAC, Policy control, and integration with Azure Resource Graph. Azure Machine Learning CLI v2 and SDK v2 use our new API platform. New services such as Managed Online Endpoint uses our new API platform.

|API Platform|ARM/Control Plane|Workspace/Data Plane|
|---|---|---|
|Legacy V1|Workspace and Compute CRUD|All Other Operations|
|New V2|All Operations|N/A|
|Network Isolation Method|ARM Private Link|Azure ML Workspace Private Link|

## What are the Network Isolation Changes with V2

Workspace Private Link works only for Workspace/Data Plane operations. Our new API Platform uses ARM/Control Plane, which means Workspace Private Link cannot provide network isolation for our new API Platform. You must be curious about what data is exposed to the internet to access our new API Platform on ARM. Metadata such as your resource ID and Parameters related to your machine learning operations are included in the ARM communication. You can find Metadata example [here](/rest/api/azureml/jobs/create-or-update) and Parameters example [here](/azure/machine-learning/reference-yaml-job-command). 

It is acceptable for most of you because it does not include your data for training and scoring inside your storage accounts, and it is encrypted with TLS 1.2. Public ARM access is a widely accepted practice for all Azure services. However, Azure Machine Learning will provide additional parameter to keep using only v1 legacy API platform.

## Scenarios and Required Actions

>[!WARNING]
>This parameter is not implemented yet. It will be implemented in **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**.

We provide a new workspace level parameter called v1_legacy_mode. If you use a public workspace, no action is required. If you want to use v2 API platform with a private link enabled workspace, you need to disable v1_legacy_mode parameter by yourself. If you enable it, you cannot use CLI v2, SDK v2, new features available only on v2 such as managed online endpoint.

|Scenario|v1_legacy_mode parameter default value|Required Actions|
|---|---|---|
|Public Workspace (both new and existing)| disabled | No action required, you can use v2.|
|Private Link Enabled Workspace (both new and existing)| enabled |No action required to keep using V1. You need to disable the parameter to use V2.|

## How to update v1_legacy_mode parameter

>[!WARNING]
>This parameter is not implemented yet. It will be implemented in **XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX**.

To update v1_legacy_mode, use the following steps:

# [Python](#tab/python)

To disable v1_legacy_mode, use [Workspace.update](/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.workspace(class)#update-friendly-name-none--description-none--tags-none--image-build-compute-none--service-managed-resources-settings-none--primary-user-assigned-identity-none--allow-public-access-when-behind-vnet-none-) and set `v1_legacy_mode=Disabled`.

```python
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.from_config()
ws.update(v1_legacy_mode=Enabled)
```


# [Azure CLI extension 2.0 preview](#tab/azurecliextensionv2)

When using the Azure CLI [extension 2.0 CLI preview for machine learning](how-to-configure-cli.md), create a YAML document that sets the `v1_legacy_mode` property to `Disabled`. Then use the `az ml update` command to update the workspace:

```yml
$schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/workspace.schema.json
name: mlw-privatelink-prod
location: eastus
display_name: Private Link endpoint workspace-example
description: When using private link, you must set the image_build_compute property to a cluster name to use for Docker image environment building. You can also specify whether the workspace should be accessible over the internet.
image_build_compute: cpu-compute
v1_legacy_mode: Enabled
tags:
  purpose: demonstration
```

```azurecli
az ml workspace update \
    -n <workspace-name> \
    -f workspace.yml
    -g <resource-group-name>
```

# [Azure CLI extension 1.0](#tab/azurecliextensionv1)

The Azure CLI [extension 1.0 for machine learning](reference-azure-machine-learning-cli.md) provides the [az ml workspace update](/cli/azure/ml/workspace#az-ml-workspace-update) command. To enable public access to the workspace, add the parameter `--v1-legacy-mode disabled`.


## Policy Control

You can use (**we need to add link**) built-in policy to control v1_legacy_mode parameter on the workspace.

## ARM Private Link
