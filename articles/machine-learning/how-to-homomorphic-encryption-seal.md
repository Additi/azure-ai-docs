# How to deploy an encrypted image classification service

Learn how to deploy an image classification model as a encrypted inferencing web service in [Azure Container Instances](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-instances/) (ACI). A web service is an image, in this case a Docker image, that encapsulates the scoring logic and the model itself.

In this part of the tutorial, you use Azure Machine Learning service to:

> * Set up your testing environment
> * Retrieve the model from your workspace
> * Test the model locally
> * Deploy the model to ACI
> * Test the deployed model

ACI is a great solution for testing and understanding the workflow. For scalable production deployments, consider using Azure Kubernetes Service. For more information, see [how to deploy and where](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-deploy-and-where).

## Prerequisites

Complete the model training in the [Train an image classification model with Azure Machine Learning tutorial](tutorial-train-models-with-aml.md).

```python
# If you did NOT complete the tutorial, you can instead run this cell 
# This will register a model and download the data needed for this tutorial
# These prerequisites are created in the training tutorial
# Feel free to skip this cell if you completed the training tutorial 

# register a model
from azureml.core import Workspace
ws = Workspace.from_config()

from azureml.core.model import Model

model_name = "sklearn_mnist"
model = Model.register(model_path="sklearn_mnist_model.pkl",
                        model_name=model_name,
                        tags={"data": "mnist", "model": "classification"},
                        description="Mnist handwriting recognition",
                        workspace=ws)


```

### Setup the Environment 

Add `encrypted-inference` package as a conda dependency 

```python
from azureml.core.environment import Environment
from azureml.core.conda_dependencies import CondaDependencies

# to install required packages
env = Environment('tutorial-env')
cd = CondaDependencies.create(pip_packages=['azureml-dataprep[pandas,fuse]>=1.1.14', 'azureml-defaults', 'azure-storage-blob', 'encrypted-inference==0.9'], conda_packages = ['scikit-learn==0.22.1'])

env.python.conda_dependencies = cd

# Register environment to re-use later
env.register(workspace = ws)
```

## Set up the environment

Start by setting up a testing environment.

### Import packages

Import the Python packages needed for this tutorial.

```python tags=["check version"]
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 
import azureml.core

# display the core SDK version number
print("Azure ML SDK Version: ", azureml.core.VERSION)
```

#### Install Homomorphic Encryption based library for Secure Inferencing

Our library is based on [Microsoft SEAL](https://github.com/Microsoft/SEAL) and pubished to [PyPi.org](https://pypi.org/project/encrypted-inference) as an easy to use package 

```python
!pip install encrypted-inference==0.9
```

## Deploy as web service

Deploy the model as a web service hosted in ACI. 

To build the correct environment for ACI, provide the following:
* A scoring script to show how to use the model
* A configuration file to build the ACI
* The model you trained before

### Create scoring script

Create the scoring script, called score.py, used by the web service call to show how to use the model.

You must include two required functions into the scoring script:
* The `init()` function, which typically loads the model into a global object. This function is run only once when the Docker container is started. 

* The `run(input_data)` function uses the model to predict a value based on the input data. Inputs and outputs to the run typically use JSON for serialization and de-serialization, but other formats are supported. The function fetches homomorphic encryption based public keys that are uploaded by the service caller. 



```python
%%writefile score.py
import json
import os
import pickle
import joblib
from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient, BlobClient, ContainerClient, PublicAccess
from encrypted.inference.eiserver import EIServer

def init():
    global model
    # AZUREML_MODEL_DIR is an environment variable created during deployment.
    # It is the path to the model folder (./azureml-models/$MODEL_NAME/$VERSION)
    # For multiple models, it points to the folder containing all deployed models (./azureml-models)
    model_path = os.path.join(os.getenv('AZUREML_MODEL_DIR'), 'sklearn_mnist_model.pkl')
    model = joblib.load(model_path)

    global server
    server = EIServer(model.coef_, model.intercept_, verbose=True)

def run(raw_data):

    json_properties = json.loads(raw_data)

    key_id = json_properties['key_id']
    conn_str = json_properties['conn_str']
    container = json_properties['container']
    data = json_properties['data']

    # download the Galois keys from blob storage
    #TODO optimize by caching the keys locally  
    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string(conn_str=conn_str)
    blob_client = blob_service_client.get_blob_client(container=container, blob=key_id)
    public_keys = blob_client.download_blob().readall()

    result = {}
    # make prediction
    result = server.predict(data, public_keys)

    # you can return any data type as long as it is JSON-serializable
    return result
```

### Create configuration file

Create a deployment configuration file and specify the number of CPUs and gigabyte of RAM needed for your ACI container. While it depends on your model, the default of 1 core and 1 gigabyte of RAM is usually sufficient for many models. If you feel you need more later, you would have to recreate the image and redeploy the service.

```python tags=["configure web service", "aci"]
from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice

aciconfig = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores=1, 
                                               memory_gb=1, 
                                               tags={"data": "MNIST",  "method" : "sklearn"}, 
                                               description='Encrypted Predict MNIST with sklearn + SEAL')
```

### Deploy in ACI

Estimated time to complete: **about 2-5 minutes**

Configure the image and deploy. The following code goes through these steps:

1. Create environment object containing dependencies needed by the model using the environment file (`myenv.yml`)
1. Create inference configuration necessary to deploy the model as a web service using:
   * The scoring file (`score.py`)
   * envrionment object created in previous step
1. Deploy the model to the ACI container.
1. Get the web service HTTP endpoint.

```python tags=["configure image", "create image", "deploy web service", "aci"]
%%time
from azureml.core.webservice import Webservice
from azureml.core.model import InferenceConfig
from azureml.core.environment import Environment
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core.model import Model

ws = Workspace.from_config()
model = Model(ws, 'sklearn_mnist')

myenv = Environment.get(workspace=ws, name="tutorial-env")
inference_config = InferenceConfig(entry_script="score.py", environment=myenv)

service = Model.deploy(workspace=ws, 
                       name='sklearn-mnist-svc', 
                       models=[model], 
                       inference_config=inference_config, 
                       deployment_config=aciconfig)

service.wait_for_deployment(show_output=True)
```

Get the scoring web service's HTTP endpoint, which accepts REST client calls. This endpoint can be shared with anyone who wants to test the web service or integrate it into an application.

```python tags=["get scoring uri"]
print(service.scoring_uri)
```

### Download test data

Download the test data to the **./data/** directory

```python
import os
from azureml.core import Dataset
from azureml.opendatasets import MNIST

data_folder = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data')
os.makedirs(data_folder, exist_ok=True)

mnist_file_dataset = MNIST.get_file_dataset()
mnist_file_dataset.download(data_folder, overwrite=True)
```

### Load test data

Load the test data from the **./data/** directory created during the training tutorial.

```python
from utils import load_data
import os
import glob

data_folder = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'data')
# note we also shrink the intensity values (X) from 0-255 to 0-1. This helps the neural network converge faster
X_test = load_data(glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder,"**/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz"), recursive=True)[0], False) / 255.0
y_test = load_data(glob.glob(os.path.join(data_folder,"**/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz"), recursive=True)[0], True).reshape(-1)
```

### Predict test data

Feed the test dataset to the model to get predictions.

The following code goes through these steps:

1. Create our Homomorphic Encryption based client 

1. Upload HE generated public keys 

1. Encrypt the data

1. Send the data as JSON to the web service hosted in ACI. 

1. Use the SDK's `run` API to invoke the service. You can also make raw calls using any HTTP tool such as curl.
<!-- #endregion -->

#### Create our Homomorphic Encryption based client 

Create a new EILinearRegressionClient and setup the public keys 

```python
from encrypted.inference.eiclient import EILinearRegressionClient

# Create a new Encrypted inference client and a new secret key.
edp = EILinearRegressionClient(verbose=True)

public_keys_blob, public_keys_data = edp.get_public_keys()

```

#### Upload HE generated public keys

Upload the public keys to the workspace default blob store. This will allow us to share the keys with the inference server

```python
import azureml.core
from azureml.core import Workspace, Datastore
import os

ws = Workspace.from_config()

datastore = ws.get_default_datastore()
container_name=datastore.container_name

# Create a local file and write the keys to it
public_keys = open(public_keys_blob, "wb")
public_keys.write(public_keys_data)
public_keys.close()

# Upload the file to blob store
datastore.upload_files([public_keys_blob])

# Delete the local file
os.remove(public_keys_blob)
```

#### Encrypt the data 

```python
#choose any one sample from the test data 
sample_index = 1

#encrypt the data
raw_data = edp.encrypt(X_test[sample_index])

```

#### Send the test data to the webservice hosted in ACI

Feed the test dataset to the model to get predictions. We will need to send the connection string to the blob storage where the public keys were uploaded 

```python
import json
from azureml.core import Webservice

service = Webservice(ws, 'sklearn-mnist-svc')

#pass the connection string for blob storage to give the server access to the uploaded public keys 
conn_str_template = 'DefaultEndpointsProtocol={};AccountName={};AccountKey={};EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net'
conn_str = conn_str_template.format(datastore.protocol, datastore.account_name, datastore.account_key)

#build the json 
data = json.dumps({"data": raw_data, "key_id" : public_keys_blob, "conn_str" : conn_str, "container" : container_name })
data = bytes(data, encoding='ASCII')

print ('Making an encrypted inference web service call ')
eresult = service.run(input_data=data)

print ('Received encrypted inference results')
```

#### Decrypt the data

Use the client to decrypt the results

```python
import numpy as np

results = edp.decrypt(eresult)

print ('Decrypted the results ', results)

#Apply argmax to identify the prediction result
prediction = np.argmax(results)

print ( ' Prediction : ', prediction)
print ( ' Actual Label : ', y_test[sample_index])
```

## Clean up resources

To keep the resource group and workspace for other tutorials and exploration, you can delete only the ACI deployment using this API call:

```python tags=["delete web service"]
service.delete()
```

If you're not going to use what you've created here, delete the resources you just created with this quickstart so you don't incur any charges. In the Azure portal, select and delete your resource group. You can also keep the resource group, but delete a single workspace by displaying the workspace properties and selecting the Delete button.
