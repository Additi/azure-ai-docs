# Authentication for managed online endpoints

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-dev-v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

This article explains the kinds of authentication that are available for operations that you perform on online endpoints. These operations fall into one of two categories, namely, control plane operations and data plane operations.

_Control plane operations_ control and can change the online endpoints themselves. These operations include create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on online endpoints and online deployments. For online endpoints and deployments, requests to perform control plane operations go to the Azure Machine Learning workspace.

_Data plane operations_ don't change the online endpoints but use data to interact with the endpoints. An example of a data plane operation is to send a scoring request to an online endpoint and get a response from it. For online endpoints and deployments, request to perform data plane operations go to the scoring URI of the online endpoint.

## Authentication for control plane operations

For control plane operations, you use the authentication to the workspace, based on Microsoft Entra ID. Depending on your use case, you can choose from several authentication flows. Your identity of choice also needs to have a proper Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allowed for access to your resources. For more information on setting up authentication, see [Set up authentication for Azure Machine Learning resources and workflows](how-to-setup-authentication.md).

## Authorization for control plane operations

For control plane operations, your identity of choice needs to have a proper Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allowed for access to your resources. Specifically, for CRUD operations on online endpoints and deployments, you need the identity to have the role assigned with the following actions:

@seokjin To do...

| Operation | Required Azure RBAC action |
| -- | -- |
| Create/update operations on online endpoints and deployments | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/write` on the scope of the workspace. |
| Delete operations on online endpoints and deployments | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/delete` on the scope of the workspace. |
| Create/update/delete operations on online endpoints and deployments via the Azure Machine Learning studio | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.Resources/deployments/write` on the scope of the resource group where the workspace belongs. |
| Read operations on online endpoints and deployments | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/read` on the scope of the workspace. |
| Fetch an Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`) for invoking online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) from the workspace | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/token/action` on the scope of the endpoint. |
| Fetch a key for invoking online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) from the workspace | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/listKeys/action` on the scope of the endpoint. |
| Regenerate keys for online endpoints (both managed and Kubernetes) | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/regenerateKeys/action` on the scope of the endpoint. |
| Fetch a Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`) for invoking *managed* online endpoints | - |

> [!NOTE]
> You can fetch Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`) directly from Microsoft Entra ID, and you don't need Azure RBAC permission on the workspace.

For more information on managing authorization to an Azure Machine Learning workspace, see [Manage access to Azure Machine Learning](how-to-assign-roles.md).

## Authentication for data plane operations

For data plane operations, you can choose from three ways to authenticate a client to send requests to the scoring URI of an endpoint:

- key
- Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`)
- Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`) 

For more information on how to authenticate clients for data plane operations, see [How to authenticate for an online endpoint](how-to-authenticate-online-endpoint.md).

## Authorization for data plane operations

For data plane operations, your identity of choice needs to have a proper Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) allowed for access to your resources, only if the endpoint is set to use Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`). Specifically, for data plane operations on online endpoints and deployments, you need the identity to have the role assigned with the following actions:

@seokjin To do...

| Operation | Required Azure RBAC action |
| -- | -- |
| Invoke *managed* online endpoints with Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`). | Owner, contributor, or custom role allowing `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/score/action` on the scope of the endpoint. |
| Invoke online endpoints with key or Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`). | - |

## Assigning roles for authorization

Azure RBAC allows you to define and assign a role with a set of allowed and/or denied actions on a specific scope. For more information on guidelines for control plane operations, see [Manage access to Azure Machine Learning](how-to-assign-roles.md). For more information on role definition, scope, and role assignment, see [Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).

You can define the permission action according to your business needs. For example, you can use the permission action `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/onlineEndpoints/*/actions` if you want to control all operations listed in the previous tables for control plane operations and data plane operations altogether.

You can also define the scopes according to your business needs. For example, you can use the scope `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspaceName>/onlineEndpoints/<endpointName>` if you want to control the operations for a specific endpoint. You can also use the scope `/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<workspaceName>` if you want to control the operations for all endpoints in a workspace. To understand the scope for assigned roles, see [Understand scope for Azure RBAC](/azure/role-based-access-control/scope-overview).


## Limitation

Entra ID authentication (`aad_token`) is supported for managed online endpoints only. For Kubernetes online endpoints, you can use either a key or an Azure Machine Learning token (`aml_token`).
