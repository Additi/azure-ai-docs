# What are the Azure Machine Learning preview features?

Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is an integrated, end-to-end data science solution for professional data scientists to develop, experiment and deploy advanced analytics applications at cloud scale.

The preview features include five components:
- [**Workbench**](#workbench)
- [**Experimentation**](#experimentation-service)
- [**Model Management Service**](#model-management-service)
- [**MMLSpark Library**](#mmlspark-library)
- [**OpenMind**](#openmind)

In addition, you can use **Azure Machine Learning Studio**, a collaborative, drag-and-drop tool that provides predefined machine learning algorithms and push-button model deployment. For more information, see [What is Machine Learning Studio?](../studio/what-is-ml-studio.md).
