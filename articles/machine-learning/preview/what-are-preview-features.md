# What are the Azure Machine Learning preview features?

Microsoft Azure Machine Learning is an integrated, end-to-end data science solution for professional data scientists to develop, experiment and deploy advanced analytics applications at cloud scale.

The preview features include five components:
- [Workbench](preview-features-workbench.md)
- [Experimentation Service](preview-features-experimentation.md)
- [Model Management Service](preview-features-model-management.md)
- [MMLSpark Library](preview-features-mmlspark.md)
- [OpenMind](preview-features-openmind.md)

In addition, you can use **Azure Machine Learning Studio**, a collaborative, drag-and-drop tool that provides predefined machine learning algorithms and push-button model deployment. For more information, see [What is Machine Learning Studio?](../studio/what-is-ml-studio.md).
