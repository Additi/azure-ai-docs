# Supported Data Sources for this release 

The supported data sources for this release are listed below.

## Types 
### Directory vs File
Files/Directories - Choose a single file and read it into Data Prep, the file type is parsed to determine the default parameters for the file connection that is on the next screen. Choose a directory or set of files within a directory (the file picker is multiselect), using either approach results in the files being read in as a single dataflow with the files appended to each other (with headers stripped out if needed)

- Delimited(csv, tsv, txt, etc.),

- JSON File
