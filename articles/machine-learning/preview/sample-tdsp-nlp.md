# Bio-medical entity recognition using Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning in an Azure Machine Learning Workbench TDSP project


This topic provides a TDSP project sample that uses Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning for bio-medical entity recognition in Azure Machine Learning Workbench.

TBD: Link to the sample location in github.


## Next steps
