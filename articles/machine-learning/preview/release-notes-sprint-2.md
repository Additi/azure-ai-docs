# Sprint 2 - December 2017 

#### Version number: 0.1.1711.15243

Welcome to the third update of Azure Machine Learning Workbench. We continue to make improvements in the workbench app, the Command-line Interface (CLI), and the back-end services. Thank you very much for sending us smiles and frowns. Many of the following updates are made as direct results of your feedback. Please keep them coming!

## Notable New Features
- Deep Learning on Spark with GPU support using MMLSpark
- Enabled Azure ML model management containers for Azure IoT Edge compatibility
- Registered model list and detail views available Azure Portal

## Detailed Updates
Following is a list of detailed updates in each component area of Azure Machine Learning in this sprint.

### Installer
- Installer can self update so that bugs fixes and new features can be supported without user having to reinstall it

### Workbench
- Read-only file view now has light blue background
- Moved Edit button to the right to make it more discoverable.
- "dsource", "dprep", and "ipynb" file formats can now be rendered in raw text format

### MMLSpark
- Deep Learning on Spark with GPU support
- Support for Resource Manager templates for easy resource deployment

### Data preparation 
- A Pattern Frequency Inspector to view the string patterns in a column. You can also filter your data using these patterns.

- Fixed issue with converting multiple columns to date

- Fixed issue that user could select output column as a source in Derive Column By Example if user changed output column name in the advanced mode.

### Job execution
- Ability to access compute targets using key-based SSH in addition to username/password-based access.

### Visual Studio Tools for AI. 
- Added support for [Visual Studio Tools for AI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.vstoolsai-vs2017). 

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Added `az ml datasource create` command allows creating a data source file from the command-line

### Model Management and Operationalization

- AML model management containers are compatible with Azure IoT Edge devices when operationalized (no extra steps required)
- Improvements of error messages in the o16n CLI
- Bug fixes in model management portal UX  
- Consistent letter casing for model management attributes in the detail page
- Realtime scoring calls timeout set to 60 seconds
- Registered model list and detail views available in the Azure portal

### Sample projects
- Iris and SparkMML samples updated with the new Azure ML SDK version

## BREAKING CHANGES
- Promoted the `--type` switch in `az ml computecontext attach` to a sub-command. 

- `az ml computecontext attach --type remotedocker` is now `az ml computecontext attach remotedocker`

- `az ml computecontext attach --type cluster` is now `az ml computecontext attach cluster`
