# Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning
Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning is a development extension to build, test, and deploy Deep Learning / AI solutions. It features a seamless integration with Azure Machine Learning, notably a run history view, detailing the performance of previous trainings and custom metrics. It offers a samples explorer view, allowing to browse and bootstrap new project with CNTK, TensorFlow, and other deep-learning framework. It also provides an explorer for compute targets.  
 
## Getting started 
To get started, you first need to download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). Once you have Visual Studio Code open, do the following steps:
1. Click on the extension icon in the activity bar (it's the last one). 
2. Search for "Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning". 
3. Click on the **Install** button. 
4. After installation, click on **Reload** button. 

Once Visual Studio Code is reladed, the extension is activated. 

## Exploring project samples
Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning comes with a samples explorer. To open the explorer, do as follow:   
1. Open the command palette (View > **Command Palette** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**).
2. Enter "ML Sample". 
3. You get a recommendation for "Machine Learning: Open Azure Machine Learning Samples Explorer", select and press enter. 

Alternatively, you can click on the samples explorer icon.

## Creating a new project from the sample explorer 
You can browse different samples and get more information about them. Let browse until finding the "Classifying Iris" sample. To create a new project based on this sample do the following:
1. Click install button on the project sample, notice the commands being prompted, walking you the steps of creating a new project. 
2. Choose a name for the project, enter "Iris".
3. Choose a folder path to create your project and press enter. 
4. Select an existing workspace and press enter.

The project will then be created.

## Submitting experiment with the new project
The new project being open, we submit a job to our different compute target (local and VM with docker).
Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning provides multiple ways to submit an experiment. 
1. Context Menu (right click) - **Machine Learning: Submit Job**.
2. From the command palette: "Machine Learning: Submit Job".
3. Alternatively, you can run the command directly using Azure CLI, Machine Learning Commands, using the embedded terminal.

Open iris_sklearn.py, right click and select **Machine Learning: Submit Job**.
1. Select your platform: "Azure Machine Learning".
2. Select your run-configuration: "Docker-Python."

> [!NOTE]
> If it is the first time your submit a job, you receive a message "No Machine Learning configuration found, creating...". A JSON file is opened, save it (**Ctrl+S**).

Once the job is submitted, the embedded-terminal displays the progress of the runs. 

## View list of jobs
Once the jobs are submitted, you can list the jobs from the run history.
1. Open the command palette (View > **Command Palette** or **Ctrl+Shift+P**).
2. Enter "ML List."
3. You get a recommendation for "Machine Learning: List Jobs", select and press enter.
4. Select the platform "Azure Machine Learning."

The Job List View opens and displays all the runs and some related information.

## View job details
With the Job List View still open, click on the first run in the list.
To deep dive into the results of a job, click on the top **job ID** to see detailed information.
