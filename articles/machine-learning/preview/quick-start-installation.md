## Install Azure Machine Learning Workbench on macOS operating system.
Install the Azure Machine Learning Workbench on your computer running macOS Sierra or newer.

1. Install openssl library using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh). See [Prerequisite for .NET Core on Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/core/macos-prerequisites) for more details.
    ```
    # only needed if you have Python 3.6 or later installed
    /Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command

    # install Homebrew first if you don't have it already
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

    # install latest openssl needed for .NET Core 1.x
    brew update
    brew install openssl
    mkdir -p /usr/local/lib
    ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/
    ln -s /usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/
    ```

2. Download the latest Azure ML Workbench installer
**[AmlWorkbench.dmg](https://aka.ms/azureml-wb-dmg)**.

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    >Download the installer fully on disk, then launch it from there. Do not launch it directly off your browser's download widget.

3. Double-click the downloaded installer _AmlWorkbench.dmg_.

4. Finish the installation by following the on-screen instructions.

   The installer will download all the necessary dependent component such as Python, Miniconda, Azure ML CLI, Azure ML SDK, Azure ML Data Profile. The installation may take around half an hour to finish all the components. 

5. Azure ML Workbench is installed in the following directory: _/Applications/AmlWorkbench.app_

## Run Azure ML Workbench to log in the first time
1. Click on the **Launch Workbench** button on the last screen of the installer once the installation process is complete. If you have closed the installer, find the shortcut to the Machine Learning Workbench on your desktop and start menu named **Azure Machine Learning Workbench**. Double-click it to open the app.

2. Log in to the Workbench using the same account you used earlier to provision your Azure resources. 

3. When the login process has succeeded, Azure ML Workbench attempts to find the ML Experimentation accounts you created earlier. It searches within the entire set of Azure subscriptions to which your credentials are attached. When at least one Experimentation Account is found, Azure ML Workbench opens with that account. It then lists the Workspaces and Projects found in that account. 

Once the installation process is complete and you log in successfully, move on to installing optional components.

## Install optional components
Azure ML Workbench can run experiments in various compute targets. To use these execution targets, install additional components, and create or obtain access to additional computation resources in Azure:
* Execute on your local **Windows or macOS computer**
   * There is no additional requirements.
* Execute in a **local Docker container**
   * You must have Docker engine installed and running. Follow [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to install Docker on your operation system.
* Execute in a **Docker container on a remote Linux machine**
   * You must have SSH access (username and password) to the Linux VM, and you must have Docker engine installed and running on that machine.
   * We recommend you [create a Ubuntu-based DSVM (Data Science Virtual Machine) on Azure](../data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro.md), which has Docker pre-installed so it is ready to go. Also make sure you use username/password for credentials, not SSH public key.
* Execute in an **HDInsight Spark cluster**
   * You must have SSH access (username and password) to the head node of that HDInsight Spark cluster. Here are the instructions on [provisioning a HDInsight Spark cluster](../../hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql.md).
* Deploy a web service to run **locally on your machine**
   * This requires a local Docker installation. Follow [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to install Docker on your operation system.
* Deploy a web service to run in an **Azure Container Service Kubernetes cluster**
   * You can set up the cluster in advance, or use Model Management CLI setup command to create it for you.

## Special note on Docker for Windows 
You need Docker to execute scripts in a local Docker container, or to deploy model via a containerized web service locally. We have some tips for installing and configuring Docker for Azure Machine Learning on Windows.  Make sure you follow these instructions:
- Only Windows 10 is supported for running Docker for Windows.
- Install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and have it up and running.
- Make sure your Docker engine is running in [Linux Container mode](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers).
- Optionally, for better execution performance, share C drive (or whichever drive the system _%temp%_ folder is) in the Docker for Windows configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> When using Docker on Windows, the Docker container runs inside of a guest Linux VM on the Windows host via Hyper-V. You can see the Linux VM by opening up Hyper-V manager on your Windows OS.
