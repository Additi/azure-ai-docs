# IDE Integration with Azure ML Workbench

## Prerequisites
To step through this how-to guide, you need one of the following IDE:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

You also need to have an Azure Machine Learning (ML) experimentation account and the Azure ML Workbench.

## Configure Project IDE 
In Azure ML Workbench, click on **File** > **Configure Project IDE**.

A form with two fields shows up.
- Name: Name of the IDE. 
- Execution Path: The path to your IDE.

## Open a Project with an IDE
Once you have a project open in Azure ML Workbench, a new context menu is activated allowing to open the project in the IDE you have previously configured. Click on **File** > **Open Project (...)** to open the project folder in the IDE and to configure the IDE embedded terminal to interact with Azure ML Command Line Interface (CLI).
