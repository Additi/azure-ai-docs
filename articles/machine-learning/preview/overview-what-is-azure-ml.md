# What is Azure Machine Learning

## Introduction

Azure Machine Learning is an integrated, end-to-end data science and advanced analytics solution for professional data scientists to prepare data, develop experiments and deploy models at cloud scale.

The core components of Azure Machine Learning are:
- Azure Machine Learning Workbench
- Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service
- Azure Machine Learning Model Management Service
- Microsoft Machine Learning Libraries for Apache Spark (MMLSpark Library)
- Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning

Together, these applications and services help significantly accelerate the rate of iteration of your data science experiments.

## Azure Machine Learning Workbench
Azure ML is designed as a code-first, extensible machine learning platform. Workbench is a desktop application plus command-line tools for preparing data, and managing experiments execution.
- Data connection, import, preparation, and wrangling 
- Notebook and IDE integration
- Collaboration and sharing
- Model creation, lineage, and version control
- Model scoring, statistics, and comparison
- Registration, deployment, monitoring and retraining of production models

The Azure Machine Learning Workbench is our companion application for the Experimentation and Model Management. The application allows you to manage machine learning solutions through the entire data science life cycle--from data ingestion, through deployment and monitoring. Workbench is a downloadable desktop application available for Windows and macOS. It  includes powerful, built-in data tools that learns your data preparation steps as you perform them. Project management, run history, and notebook integration are all included. We've also included the best open source machine learning frameworks including TensorFlow, Cognitive Toolkit, Spark ML, and scikit-learn. Additionally, Workbench is compatible with any Python or PySpark code and a number of popular machine learning IDEs. 

## Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service

The Experimentation Service is a managed Azure service that allows you to build, test, and compare machine learning models locally or in the cloud. The service supports all machine learning Python libraries, whether proprietary to your business or open-source. (The installation of Workbench includes a wide range of the most popular open source machine learning libraries, including Spark, CNTK, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn.)  The service is also integrated by default with Visual Studio and Github. This integration enables collaboration, data and model history, lineage, and back-ups. Lastly, the Experimentation Service is deeply integrated with Docker and uses industry standard Docker containers to enable model portability and reproducibility across environments. 

## Azure Machine Learning Model Management Service

Model Management is a managed Azure service that allows data scientists and dev-ops teams to deploy predictive models reliably into a wide variety of environments. The service uses the same GIT repository designated by the Experimentation Service. Using Git, models are versioned and model lineage is tracked. Model Management uses Docker to manage and deploy models reliably to local machines, Azure, or IoT edge devices. Models are deployed via Linux-based Docker containers that include the model and all encompassing dependencies. Containers are registered with Azure Container Registry and in the case of cloud deployments, pushed to Azure Container Service. For cluster deployments, Kubernetes is used to manage and load balance across containers. 


## Microsoft Machine Learning Library for Apache Spark
[MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark)(Microsoft Machine Learning Library for Apach Spark) is an open-source Spark package that provides deep learning and data science tools for Apache Spark, including integration of [Spark ML Pipelines](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/ml-pipeline.html) with [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) Library. It enables you to quickly create powerful, highly-scalable predictive and analytical models for large image and text datasets.

## Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning
VS Code Tool for ML is the Azure ML extension for VS Code.

## What are the machine learning options in Azure?
There are a wide variety of options in Azure to build, deploy, and manage machine learning models. 
* Azure Machine Learning
* Microsoft Machine Learning Services in SQL
* Data Science Virtual Machine
* Spark MLLib in HDInsight
* Batch AI Training Service
* Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit

### Azure Machine Learning
[Azure Machine Learning](../index.md) manages the end to end development of machine learning and AI models in Azure.  [Machine Learning Studio](../studio/what-is-ml-studio.md) is a fully managed service enabling graphical construction of machine learning experiments with serverless training and deployment.  Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service and Azure Machine Learning Model Management are preview services that manage the creation, deployment, and management of models built using Python and any machine learning framework available for Python. You can use the [Azure Machine Learning Workbench](what-is-ml-workbench.md) to build data preparation jobs, author models using notebooks, and manage the history of your training jobs. 

Use Azure Machine Learning when you want to manage the end to end development.  Azure Machine Learning enables you to use the other services mentioned on this page to scale in the cloud, while providing you with management of the end to end lifecycle from data preparation, model creation, through deployment and monitoring. 

### Microsoft Machine Learning Services in SQL 
[Microsoft Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/r/r-services) enables you to run train and deploy machine learning models using R or Python, on data located on-premises and in SQL Server databases. 

Use Microsoft Machine Learning Services when you need to train or deploy models on-premises, or when you need to train inside of Microsoft SQL Server.  Models built with Machine Learning Services can be deployed using Azure Machine Learning Model Management. 

### Data Science Virtual Machine
The [Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-data-science-virtual-machine-overview) is a customized VM image on Microsoftâ€™s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics. It is available on Windows Server and on Linux. We offer Windows edition of DSVM on Server 2016 and Server 2012. We offer Linux edition of the DSVM on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and on OpenLogic 7.2 CentOS-based Linux distributions. 

Use the Data Science Virtual Machine when you need to run or host your jobs on a single node, or to remotely scale up your processing on a single machine.  The Data Science Virtual Machine is supported as a target for both Azure Machine Learning Experimentation as well as Azure Machine Learning Model Management. 

### Spark MLLib in HDInsight
[Spark MLLib in HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-ipython-notebook-machine-learning) lets you create models as part of Spark jobs that are executing on big data. Spark lets you easily transform and prepare data and then scale out model creation in a single job.  Models created through Spark MLLib can be deployed, managed, and monitored through Azure Machine Learning Model Management, while training runs can be dispatched and managed with Azure Machine Learning Experimentation.  Spark can also be used for scaling out data preparation jobs authored in the Machine Learning Workbench. 

Use Spark when you need to scale out your data processing and create models as part of a data pipeline. You can author Spark jobs in Scala, Java, Python, or R. 

### Batch AI Training 
[Azure Batch AI Training](https://aka.ms/batchaitraining) helps you experiment in parallel with your AI models using any framework and then trains them at scale across clustered GPUs. Describe your job requirements and configuration to run, and we handle the rest. 

Use Batch AI Training when you need to scale out deep learning jobs across clustered GPUs using frameworks such as Cognitive Toolkit, Caffe, Chainer, TensorFlow, and more.  Azure Machine Learning Model Management can be used to take models from Batch AI Training to deploy, manage, and monitor them.  Batch AI Training will be integrated with Azure Machine Learning Experimentation in the future. 

### Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit
The [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/), is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows you to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.

Use the Cognitive Toolkit when you want to build a model using deep learning.  The Cognitive Toolkit can be used in any of the preceding services.
