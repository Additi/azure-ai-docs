## Open and Powerful
So much innovation in the data science and machine learning world is happening in the open-source community. Azure Machine Learning fully embraces open-source technologies. You can leverage tens of thousands of open-source Python packages, including popular machine learning frameworks including [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/), [Spark ML](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/ml-pipeline.html) and many more. You can execute your experiments in managed environments such as Docker containers and Spark clusters. And you can use advanced hardware such as [GPU-enabled virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/sizes-gpu) to accelerate your execution.

Azure ML itself is also built on top of mature and widely used open source technologies including [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/), just to name a few. It also includes Microsoft's own open-source technologies such as [Microsoft Machine Learning Library for Apache Spark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark) and Cognitive Toolkit.

In addition, you also benefit from some of the most advanced, tried-and-true machine learning technologies developed by Microsoft that are designed to solve on large-scale problems. They are battle-tested in many Microsoft products, such as Windows, Bing, Xbox, Office, SQL Server, etc., and used by billions of people in the world every day. [PROSE](https://microsoft.github.io/prose/) (PROgram Synthesis using Examples), [microsoftml, and [revoscalepy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/r-server/python-reference/revoscalepy/revoscalepy-package) are just three examples.

## Azure Machine Learning Workbench
Azure ML Workbench is a desktop application plus command-line tools, supported on both Windows and macOS. It allows you to manage machine learning solutions through the entire data science life cycle -- from data ingestion and preparation, through model development and experiment management, to model deployment in various target environments. Here are the core functionalities offered by Workbench:
- Data preparation tool that can learn data transformation logic by example.
- Data source abstraction accessible through UX and Python code.
- Python SDK for invoking visually constructed data preparation packages.
- Built-in Jupyter Notebook service and client UX.
- Experiment monitoring and management through run history views.
- Role-based access control that enables sharing and collaboration through Azure Active Directory.
- Automatic project snapshots for each run, and explicit version control enabled by native Git integration. 
- Integration with popular Python IDEs.

For more information, reference the following articles:
- [Data Preparation User Guide](data-prep-user-guide.md)
- [Using Git with Azure ML](using-git-ml-project.md)
- Using Jupyter Notebook in Azure ML
- Roaming and Sharing
- [Run History Guide](how-to-use-run-history-model-metrics.md)
- [IDE Integration](how-to-configure-your-IDE.md)

## Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service
The Experimentation Service handles the execution of machine learning experiments, as well as other vital services supporting Workbench, including project management, Git integration, access control, roaming and sharing etc. 

Through easy configuration, you can execute your experiments across a range of compute environment options, including local native, local Docker container, Docker container on a remote VM, and scale-out Spark cluster in Azure. Experimentation Service constructs virtual environments, leveraging technologies including Docker and Conda, to ensure your script can be executed in isolation and always reproducible. It records extensive run history information and presents them to you visually, so you can easily select the best model out of your experiment runs. 

For more information, please reference [Experimentation Execution Configuration](experiment-execution-configuration.md).

## Azure Machine Learning Model Management Service

Model Management Service allows data scientists and dev-ops teams to deploy predictive models into a wide variety of environments. Model versions and lineage are tracked from training runs to deployments. Models are stored, registered, and managed in the cloud. 

Using simple CLI commands, you can containerize your model, scoring scripts and dependencies into Docker images. These images are registered in your own Docker registry hosted in Azure (Azure Container Registry). They can be then reliably deployed to local machines, on-prem servers, in the cloud, or on IoT edge devices. Kubernetes running in ACS (Azure Container Service) are used for cloud scale-out deployment, and model execution telemetry is captured in AppInsights for visual analysis. 

For more information on Model Management Service, reference [Model Management Overview](model-management-overview.md)


## Microsoft Machine Learning Library for Apache Spark
[MMLSpark](https://github.com/Azure/mmlspark)(Microsoft Machine Learning Library for Apache Spark) is an open-source Spark package that provides deep learning and data science tools for Apache Spark, including integration of [Spark ML Pipelines](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/ml-pipeline.html) with [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) Library. It enables you to quickly create powerful, highly scalable predictive and analytical models for large image and text datasets. Some highlights include:
- Easily ingest images from HDFS into Spark DataFrame
- Pre-process image data using transforms from OpenCV
- Featurize images using pre-trained deep neural nets using CNTK
- Use pre-trained bidirectional LSTMs from Keras for medical entity extraction
- Train DNN-based image classification models on N-Series GPU VMs on Azure
- Featurize free-form text data using convenient APIs on top of primitives in SparkML via a single transformer
- Train classification and regression models easily via implicit featurization of data
- Compute a rich set of evaluation metrics including per-instance metrics

 For more information, reference [Using MMLSpark in Azure ML](how-to-use-mmlspark.md).


## Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning
Visual Studio Code Tools for Machine Learning is an extension in VS Code to build, test, and deploy Deep Learning and AI solutions. It features many integration points with Azure Machine Learning, including:
- A run history view displaying the performance of training runs and logged metrics.
- A gallery view allowing users to browse and bootstrap new projects with CNTK, TensorFlow, and many other deep-learning framework. 
- An explorer view for selecting compute targets for your scripts to execute.

### Azure Machine Learning
[Azure Machine Learning](../index.md) manages the end to end development of machine learning and AI models in Azure.  [Machine Learning Studio](../studio/what-is-ml-studio.md) is a fully managed service enabling graphical construction of machine learning experiments with serverless training and deployment.  Azure Machine Learning Experimentation Service and Azure Machine Learning Model Management are preview services that manage the creation, deployment, and management of models built using Python and any machine learning framework available for Python. You can use the [Azure Machine Learning Workbench](what-is-ml-workbench.md) to build data preparation jobs, author models using notebooks, and manage the history of your training jobs. 

Use Azure Machine Learning when you want to manage the end to end development.  Azure Machine Learning enables you to use the other services mentioned on this page to scale in the cloud, while providing you with management of the end to end lifecycle from data preparation, model creation, through deployment and monitoring.

### Microsoft Machine Learning Services in SQL 
[Microsoft Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/r/r-services) enables you to run train and deploy machine learning models using R or Python, on data located on-premises and in SQL Server databases. 

Use Microsoft Machine Learning Services when you need to train or deploy models on-premises, or when you need to train inside of Microsoft SQL Server.  Models built with Machine Learning Services can be deployed using Azure Machine Learning Model Management. 

### Data Science Virtual Machine
The [Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-data-science-virtual-machine-overview) is a customized VM image on Microsoft’s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics. It is available on Windows Server and on Linux. We offer Windows edition of DSVM on Server 2016 and Server 2012. We offer Linux edition of the DSVM on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and on OpenLogic 7.2 CentOS-based Linux distributions. 

Use the Data Science Virtual Machine when you need to run or host your jobs on a single node, or to remotely scale up your processing on a single machine.  The Data Science Virtual Machine is supported as a target for both Azure Machine Learning Experimentation as well as Azure Machine Learning Model Management. 

### Spark MLLib in HDInsight
[Spark MLLib in HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-ipython-notebook-machine-learning) lets you create models as part of Spark jobs that are executing on big data. Spark lets you easily transform and prepare data and then scale out model creation in a single job.  Models created through Spark MLLib can be deployed, managed, and monitored through Azure Machine Learning Model Management, while training runs can be dispatched and managed with Azure Machine Learning Experimentation.  Spark can also be used for scaling out data preparation jobs authored in the Machine Learning Workbench. 

Use Spark when you need to scale out your data processing and create models as part of a data pipeline. You can author Spark jobs in Scala, Java, Python, or R. 

### Batch AI Training 
[Azure Batch AI Training](https://aka.ms/batchaitraining) helps you experiment in parallel with your AI models using any framework and then trains them at scale across clustered GPUs. Describe your job requirements and configuration to run, and we handle the rest. 

Use Batch AI Training when you need to scale out deep learning jobs across clustered GPUs using frameworks such as Cognitive Toolkit, Caffe, Chainer, TensorFlow, and more.  Azure Machine Learning Model Management can be used to take models from Batch AI Training to deploy, manage, and monitor them.  Batch AI Training will be integrated with Azure Machine Learning Experimentation in the future. 

### Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit
The [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit/), is a unified deep-learning toolkit that describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. In this directed graph, leaf nodes represent input values or network parameters, while other nodes represent matrix operations upon their inputs. CNTK allows you to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional nets (CNNs), and recurrent networks (RNNs/LSTMs). It implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.

Use the Cognitive Toolkit when you want to build a model using deep learning.  The Cognitive Toolkit can be used in any of the preceding services.
