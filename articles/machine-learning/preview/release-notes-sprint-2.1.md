# Sprint 2 QFE - December 2017 

#### Version number: 0.1.1711.15323

>Here is how you can [find the version number](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/known-issues-and-troubleshooting-guide).

Welcome to the QFE (Quick Fix Engineering) release of the third update of Azure Machine Learning Workbench. This is a minor release addressing a bunch of telemetry issues for us to understand better how the product is being used, which will go into the planning efforts on the future releases to improve user experience. 

In addition, we also have two import updates:

- We fixed a bug in data prep that prevented the time series inspector from displaying in data preparation packages.
- In the command line tool, you no longer need to be an Azure subscription owner in order to provision Machine Learning Compute ACS clusters.
