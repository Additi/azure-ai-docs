# Region availability of Azure Machine Learning Services 

Look for supported Azure regions for experimentation and model management service under Azure Machine Learning on the [Azure Products by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/) page.

More regions will be added as we develop the product. You can help us prioritize which regions to deploy to on our [Azure Machine Learning Feedback](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/257792-machine-learning) site.
