# CLI (v2) online endpoint YAML schema

[!INCLUDE [preview disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> A fully specified sample YAML for managed online endpoints is available for [reference](https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.template.yaml)

## YAML syntax

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| `$schema` | string | The YAML schema. If you use the Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension to author the YAML file, including `$schema` at the top of your file enables you to invoke schema and resource completions. | | |
| `name` | string | **Required.** Name of the endpoint. Needs to be unique at the Azure region level. | | |
| `description` | string | Description of the endpoint. | | |
| `tags` | object | Dictionary of tags for the endpoint. | | |
| `traffic` | object | Dictionary of the percentage of traffic from the endpoint to divert to each deployment. The key is the deployment name and the value is the traffic percentage. Traffic values need to sum to `100`. | | |
| `auth_mode` | string | The authentication method for the endpoint. Key-based authentication and Azure ML token-based authentication are supported. Key-based authentication doesn't expire but Azure ML token-based authentication does. | `key`, `aml_token` | `key` |
| `allow_public_access` | boolean | Whether to allow public access when Private Link is enabled. | | `true` |
| `identity` | object | The managed identity configuration for accessing Azure resources for endpoint provisioning and inference. | | |
| `identity.type` | string | The type of managed identity. If the type is `user_assigned`, the `identity.user_assigned_identities` property must also be specified. | `system_assigned`, `user_assigned` | |
| `identity.user_assigned_identities` | array | List of fully qualified resource IDs of the user-assigned identities. | | |

TODO: does auth_mode have a default?

## Remarks

The `az ml online-endpoint` commands can be used for managing Azure Machine Learning online endpoints.

## Examples

[TODO]

## Schema

The source JSON schema can be found at https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineEndpoint.schema.json. The schema is provided below in JSON and YAML formats for convenience.
