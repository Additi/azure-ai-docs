In this tutorial, you learn the following tasks:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Understand the code
> * Create a workspace
> * Create an experiment
> * Configure Computer Targets
> * Run a configuration file
> * Train a model
> * Register a model
> * Deploy a model

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription. If you don't have one, sign up to try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview), a lightweight, cross-platform code editor.
- Azure Machine Learning Studio Visual Studio Code extension. For install instructions see the [Setup Azure Machine Learning Visual Studio Code extension tutorial](./tutorial-setup-vscode-extension.md)

## Understand the code

The code for this tutorial uses TensorFlow to train an image classification machine learning model that categorizes handwritten digits from 0-9. It does so by creating a neural network that takes the pixel values of 28px x 28px image as input and outputs a list of 10 probabilities, one for each of the digits being classified. Below is a sample of what the input data looks like.

Get the code for this tutorial by downloading and unzipping the [VS Code Tools for AI repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-tools-for-ai/archive/master.zip) anywhere on your computer.

## Create a workspace

The first thing you have to do to build an application in Azure Machine Learning is to create a workspace. A workspace is a space that contains the resources to train models as well as the trained models themselves. See the documentation to learn more about [what is a workspace](./concept-workspace.md). 

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon to open the Azure Machine Learning view.
1. Right-click your Azure subscription and select **Create Workspace**. 

    ![Create a workspace](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/create-workspace.png)]

1. By default a name is generated containing the date and time of creation. In the command palette, change the name to "TeamWorkspace" and press **Enter**.
1. Select **Create a new resource group** in the command palette. 
1. Enter "TeamWorkspace-rg" in the command palette text box and press **Enter**. 
1. In the command palette, choose a location for your workspace. It's recommended to choose a location that is closest to the location you plan to deploy your model. In this case, choose **West US 2**.
1. When prompted to select a workspace SKU, select **Basic** to create a basic workspace. Visit the [Azure Machine Learning overview](./overview-what-is-azure-ml.md#sku) to learn more about the different workspace offerings.

At this point, a request to Azure is made to create a new workspace in your account. After a few minutes, if successful, your new workspace will appear in your subscription node. 

## Create an experiment

One or more experiments can be created in your workspace to track and analyze individual model training runs. Runs can be done in the Azure cloud or on your local machine.

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon. The Azure Machine Learning view appears.
1. Expand your subscription node.
1. Expand the **TeamWorkspace** workspace node. 
1. Right-click the **Experiments** node.
1. Select **Create Experiment** from the context menu.

    ![Create an experiment](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/create-experiment.png)]

1. In the command palette prompt, name your experiment "MNIST" and press **Enter** to create the new experiment. 

Like workspaces, a request is sent to Azure to create an experiment with the provided configurations. If successful, the new experiment will appear in the *Experiments* node of your workspace. 

## Configure Compute Targets

A compute target is the computing resource or environment where you run scripts and deploy trained models to. To learn more about compute targets, see the [Azure Machine Learning compute targets documentation](./concept-compute-target.md).

To create a compute target:

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon. The Azure Machine Learning view appears. 
1. Expand your subscription node. 
1. Expand the **TeamWorkspace** workspace node. 
1. Under the workspace node, right-click the **Compute** node and choose **Create Compute**. 

    ![Create a compute target](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/create-compute.png)]

1. Select **Azure Machine Learning Compute (AmlCompute)**.
1. Choose a VM size. In the command palette prompt, select **Standard_F2s_v2**.
1. In the command palette prompt, name your compute "TeamWkspc-com" and press **Enter** to create your compute.

If successful, the new compute target will appear in the *Compute* node of your workspace.

## Create a run configuration

To run an Azure Machine Learning experiment on a compute, that compute needs to be configured appropriately. A run configuration file is the mechanism by which this environment is specified.

To create a run configuration:

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon. The Azure Machine Learning view appears. 
1. Expand your subscription node. 
1. Expand the **TeamWorkspace** workspace node. 
1. Under the workspace node, right-click the **TeamWkspc-com** compute node and choose **Create Run Configuration**.

    ![Create a run configuration](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/create-run-configuration.png)]

1. In the command palette prompt, name your run configuration "MNIST-rc" and press **Enter** to create your compute.
1. Then, select **TensorFlow Single-Node Training** as the training job type.
1. Press **Enter** to browse the script file to run on the compute. In this case, the script to train the model is the *train.py* file inside the *vscode-tools-for-ai/mnist-vscode-docs-sample* directory.
1. Enter the following into the command pallete prompt to specify the required packages.
    
    ```text
    pip: azureml-defaults; conda: python=3.6.2, tensorflow=1.15.0
    ```
1. If successful, a file called *MNIST-rc.runconfig* should appear in VS Code.

    ```json
    {
        "script": "train.py",
        "framework": "Python",
        "communicator": "None",
        "target": "TeamWkspc-com",
        "environment": {
            "python": {
                "userManagedDependencies": false,
                "condaDependencies": {
                    "dependencies": [
                        "python=3.6.2",
                        "tensorflow=1.15.0",
                        {
                            "pip": [
                                "azureml-defaults"
                            ]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },
            "docker": {
                "baseImage": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/base:0.2.4",
                "enabled": true,
                "baseImageRegistry": {
                    "address": null,
                    "username": null,
                    "password": null
                }
            }
        },
        "nodeCount": 1,
        "history": {
            "outputCollection": true,
            "snapshotProject": false,
            "directoriesToWatch": [
                "logs"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

1. When satisfied with the configuration, open the command pallette by selecting **View > Command Palette**.
1. Enter the following command into the command palette to save your run configuration file.

    ```text
    Azure ML: Save and Continue
    ```

The *MNIST-rc* run configuration should now be saved and appear under the *TeamWkspc-com* compute node.

## Train the model

To run an Azure Machine Learning experiment:

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon. The Azure Machine Learning view appears. 
1. Expand the **TeamWorkspace > Experiments** node. 
1. right-click the **MNIST** experiment.
1. Select **Run Experiment**.

    ![Run an experiment](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/run-experiment.png)]

1. In the command pallete, select the **TeamWkspc-com** compute target.
1. Then, select the **MNIST-rc** run configuration.
1. At this point, a request is sent to Azure to run your experiment on the selected compute target in your workspace. This process should take a few minutes. To track the progress of your experiment, right-click the current run node and select **View Run in Azure Portal**.
1. When the dialog requesting to open an external website appears, select **Open**.

    ![Track experiment progress](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/track-experiment-progress.png)]

When the model is done training, the label next to the run node should say "Completed".

## Register the model

Now that you've trained your model, you can register it in your workspace. 

To register your model:

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon. The Azure Machine Learning view appears.
1. Expand the **TeamWorkspace > Experiments > MNIST** node.
1. Get the model outputs generated from training the model. Right-click the **Run 1** run node and select **Download outputs**. 

    ![Download model outputs](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/download-outputs.png)]

1. Choose the directory to save the downloaded outputs to. By default, the outputs are placed in the directory currently opened in Visual Studio Code.
1. Right-click the **Models** node and choose **Register Model**.

    ![Register a model](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/register-model.png)]

1. On the command palette, name your model "MNIST-TensorFlow-model" and press **Enter**.
1. A TensorFlow model is made up of several files. Select *Model folder* as the model path format in the command palette. 
1. Select the *azureml_outputs/Run_1/outputs/Run_1/outputs/outputs/model* directory.

    A file containing your model configurations appears in Visual Studio Code with similar content to the one below:

    ```json
    {
        "modelName": "MNIST-TensorFlow-model",
        "tags": {
            "": ""
        },
        "modelPath": "c:\\Dev\\vscode-tools-for-ai\\mnist-vscode-docs-sample\\azureml_outputs\\Run_1\\outputs\\Run_1\\outputs\\outputs\\model",
        "description": ""
    }
    ```

1. Once you're satisfied with your configuration, save it by opening the command palette and entering the following command:

    ```text
    Azure ML: Save and Continue
    ```

If successful, your model should appear under the *Models* node.

## Deploy the model

In Visual Studio Code, you can deploy your model as a web service to:

+ Azure Container Instances (ACI) for testing.
+ Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for production.

You don't need to create an ACI container to test in advance, because ACI containers are created as needed. However, you do need to configure AKS clusters in advance. For more information, see [deploy models with Azure Machine Learning](how-to-deploy-and-where.md) to learn about deployment options.

To deploy a web service as an ACI :

1. On the Visual Studio Code activity bar, select the **Azure** icon. The Azure Machine Learning view appears.
1. Expand the **TeamWorkspace > Models** node. 
1. Right-click the **MNIST-TensorFlow-model** and select **Deploy Service from Registered Model**.

    ![Deploy the model](./media/tutorial-train-deploy-image-classification-model-vscode/register-model.png)]

1. On the command palette, select **Azure Container Instances**.
1. Name your service "mnist-tensorflow-svc" and press **Enter** in the command palette.
1. Choose the script to run in the container by pressing **Enter** in the command pallete and browsing for the *score.py* file in the *mnist-vscode-docs-sample* directory.
1. Provide the dependencies needed to run the script by pressing **Enter** in the command palette and browsing for the *env.yml* file in the *mnist-vscode-docs-sample* directory.

    A file containing your model configurations appears in Visual Studio Code with similar content to the one below:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "mnist-tensorflow-svc",
        "imageConfig": {
            "runtime": "python",
            "executionScript": "score.py",
            "dockerFile": null,
            "condaFile": "env.yml",
            "dependencies": [],
            "schemaFile": null,
            "enableGpu": false,
            "description": ""
        },
        "deploymentConfig": {
            "cpu_cores": 1,
            "memory_gb": 10,
            "tags": {
                "": ""
            },
            "description": ""
        },
        "deploymentType": "ACI",
        "modelIds": [
            "MNIST-TensorFlow-model:1"
        ]
    }
    ```
1. Once you're satisfied with your configuration, save it by opening the command palette and entering the following command:

    ```text
    Azure ML: Save and Continue
    ```

At this point, a request is sent to Azure to deploy your web service. The deployment process takes a few minutes. If successful, the new service should appear under the *Endpoints* node.
