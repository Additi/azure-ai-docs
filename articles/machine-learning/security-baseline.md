### 1.1: Protect Azure resources within virtual networks

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32525.).

**Guidance**: Azure Machine Learning relies on other Azure services for compute resources. Compute resources (compute targets) are used to train and deploy models. You can create these compute targets in a virtual network. For example, you can use Azure Data Science Virtual Machine to train a model and then deploy the model to AKS. You can secure your machine learning lifecycles by isolating Azure Machine Learning training and inference jobs within an Azure virtual network.

Azure Private Link enables you to connect to your workspace using a private endpoint. The private endpoint is a set of private IP addresses within your virtual network. You can then limit access to your workspace to only occur over the private IP addresses. Private Link helps reduce the risk of data exfiltration. &lt;--- private link is stil in preview for Machine Learning? confirm with owners ---&gt;

Azure Firewall can be used to control access to your Azure Machine Learning workspace and the public internet.

>[!NOTE]
> To revise the text in this section, update the [underlying Work Item](https://dev.azure.com/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmark/AzureSecurityControlsBenchmarkContent/_workitems/edit/32526.).

**Guidance**: Azure Machine Learning relies on other Azure services for compute resources. Assign network security groups to the networks that are created as your Machine Learning deployment. 

Enable network security group flow logs and send the logs to an Azure Storage account for auditing. You can also send the flow logs to a Log Analytics workspace and then use Traffic Analytics to provide insights into traffic patterns in your Azure cloud. Some advantages of Traffic Analytics are the ability to visualize network activity, identify hot spots and security threats, understand traffic flow patterns, and pinpoint network misconfigurations.
