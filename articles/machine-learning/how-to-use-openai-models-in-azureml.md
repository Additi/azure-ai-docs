In this article, you learn how to discover, finetune and deploy Azure Open AI models at scale, using Azure Machine Learning. 

## How to access Azure OpenAI models in Azure Machine Learning
The model catalog (preview) in Azure Machine learning Studio is your starting point to explore various collections of foundation models. The Azure Open AI models collection is a collection of models, exclusively available on Azure, that enables customers to access prompt engineering, finetuning, evaluation, and deployment capabilities for large language models available in Azure OpenAI Service. You can view the complete list of supported OpenAI models in the [model catalog](https://ml.azure.com/model/catalog), under the `Azure OpenAI Service` collection.

You can filter the list of models in the model catalog by inference task, or by finetuning task. Select a specific model name and see the model card for the selected model, which lists detailed information about the model. For example:
