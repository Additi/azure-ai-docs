# Quickstart: Run Juypter notebook in Azure Machine Learning studio

In this quickstart, you'll run Jupyter notebooks on a *compute instance* in Azure Machine Learning studio.  A compute instance is an online compute resource that has a development environment already installed and ready to go.  You'll use this online machine for your development environment to write and run code in Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Run the [Quickstart: Create workspace resources you need to get started with Azure Machine Learning](quickstart-create-resources.md) to create a workspace and a compute instance.

## Create a new notebook

Create a new notebook from studio.

1. Sign into [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com)
1. Select your workspace, if it isn't already open
1. On the left, select **Notebooks**
1.
