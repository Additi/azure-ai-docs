<!-- 
IMPORTANT 
To make this template easier to use, first:
1. Search and replace Machine Learning with the official name of your service.
2. Search and replace machine-learning with the service name to use in GitHub filenames.-->

<!-- VERSION 3.0 2024_01_01
For background about this template, see https://review.learn.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-monitoring?branch=main -->

<!-- Most services can use the following sections unchanged. All headings are required unless otherwise noted.
The sections use #included text you don't have to maintain, which changes when Azure Monitor functionality changes. Add info into the designated service-specific places if necessary. Remove #includes or template content that aren't relevant to your service.

At a minimum your service should have the following two articles:

1. The primary monitoring article (based on the template monitor-service-template.md)
   - Title: "Monitor Machine Learning"
   - TOC title: "Monitor"
   - Filename: "monitor-machine-learning.md"

2. A reference article that lists all the metrics and logs for your service (based on this template).
   - Title: "Machine Learning monitoring data reference"
   - TOC title: "Monitoring data reference"
   - Filename: "monitor-machine-learning-reference.md".

<!-- Find the table(s) for your service at https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype. These files are auto generated from the REST API.
NOTE: Also refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics#azure-diagnostics-mode to see whether your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table in Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics. 
Link to the service-specific tables. If your service uses the AzureDiagnostics table, list the fields you use and what they're for. If your service uses both tables, list both types of information.
