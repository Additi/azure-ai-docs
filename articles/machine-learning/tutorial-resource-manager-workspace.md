# Tutorial: Deploy an Azure machine learning workspace using a Resource Manager template
[!INCLUDE [applies-to-skus](../../includes/aml-applies-to-basic-enterprise-sku.md)]

Azure machine learning workspaces organize all your machine learning assets from baseline datasets to deployed models. Workspaces are a single location to collaborate with colleagues on creating, running, and reviewing experiments, manage your training and inferencing compute resources, and monitor and version deployed models. In this tutorial, you'll use an Azure Resource Manager template to specify and deploy an Azure ML workspace. 

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](../../includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) before you begin.

## Create a workspace

### Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure Quickstart templates](tk).

[!code-json[<Azure Resource Manager template create machine learning workspace](tk)]

The following resources are defined in the template:

* tk

### Deploy the template 

cli deployment 

## Review deployed resources
