# Designer sample pipelines

The [Azure Machine Learning designer]() GitHub repository contains the latest pipeline samples to help you get started with common machine learning scenarios. This article provides:

- How to use the designer sample pipelines
- Links to the sample pipeline docuementation

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://aka.ms/AMLFree).

* An Azure Machine Learning workspace with the Enterprise SKU.


## Use sample pipelines

Use the included sample pipelines as a base to help you quickly get started with common machine learning scenarios. 

1. Sign in to <a href="https://ml.azure.com?tabs=jre" target="_blank">ml.azure.com</a>, and select the workspace you want to work with.

1. Select **Designer**.

1. Select one of the sample pipelines in the **New pipeline** section.

1. Select **Show more samples** for a complete list of samples.
