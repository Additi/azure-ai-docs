# Package a model for online deployment

Model packages is a capability in Azure Machine Learning that allows you to collect all the dependencies required to deploy a machine learning model to a serving platform. Packages can be moved across workspaces and even outside of Azure Machine Learning. In this article you learn how package a model and deploy it to an Online Endpoint in Azure Machine Learning.

## How model packages are created?

To create a model package, you need to indicate the following:

* **Model:** The model to package.
* **Base environment:** The base image that's going to be use to package the model. Base images are indicated using **Environments** in Azure Machine Learning.
* **Inferencing Server:** The serving technology that you want to use to run the model. You can use Azure Machine Learning Inferencing Server (package `azureml-inference-server-http`) or a Custom server.

> [!NOTE]
> Each model package can contain only 1 single model. Packaging multiple models under the same package is not supported by the moment.

Let's see an example about how the package operation works.

### Follow along in Jupyter Notebooks

You can follow along this sample in the following notebooks. In the cloned repository, open the notebook: [deploy-with-packages.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/online/deploy-with-packages/deploy-with-packages.ipynb).

## Prerequisites

Follow these steps to prepare your environment:

### Connect to your workspace

First, let's connect to Azure Machine Learning workspace where we are going to work on.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az account set --subscription <subscription>
az configure --defaults workspace=<workspace> group=<resource-group> location=<location>
```

# [Python](#tab/sdk)

The workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning. In this section, we connect to the workspace in which you perform deployment tasks.

1. Import the required libraries:

    ```python
    from azure.ai.ml import MLClient, Input
    from azure.ai.ml.entities import ManagedOnlineEndpoint, ManagedOnlineDeployment, Model
    from azure.ai.ml.constants import AssetTypes
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    ```

2. If you are running in a Compute Instance in Azure Machine Learning, create an `MLClient` as follows:

    ```python
    ml_client = MLClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())
    ```

    Otherwise, configure workspace details and get a handle to the workspace:

    ```python
    subscription_id = "<subscription>"
    resource_group = "<resource-group>"
    workspace = "<workspace>"
    
    ml_client = MLClient(DefaultAzureCredential(), subscription_id, resource_group, workspace)
    ```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

Navigate to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com).

### Registering the model

In this case, we already have a local copy of the model in the repository, so we only need to publish the model to the registry in the workspace. You can skip this step if the model you are trying to deploy is already registered.
   
# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
MODEL_NAME='sklearn-diabetes'
MODEL_PATH='model'
az ml model create --name $MODEL_NAME --path $MODEL_PATH --type custom_model
```

# [Python](#tab/sdk)

```python
model_name = "sklearn-regression"
model_path = "model"
model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(
        Model(name=model_name, path=model_path, type=AssetTypes.CUSTOM_MODEL)
)
```

# [Studio](#tab/studio)

To create a model in Azure Machine Learning, open the Models page in Azure Machine Learning. Select **Register model** and select where your model is located. Fill out the required fields, and then select __Register__.

### The base environment

Models require an environment indicateing all the packages and software they needs to run. In packages, this is called the *base environment*. For MLflow models, the base environment is automatically detected by Azure Machine Learning and hence they are option. For custom models, they are required. 

In this example we will create an environment using a base image and the following conda file:

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-main/cli/endpoints/online/deploy-with-packages/environment/conda.yaml":::

> [!TIP]
> **What's the difference with the environments you use to deploy to Online or Batch Endpoints?** When you deployed to Online Endpoints, you need to include the dependencies of the model + the packages required by Managed Online Endpoints to work. This brings a manual process into the deployment where you have to combine the requirements of your model with the requirements of the serving platform. Packages remove that friction since the **required packages for the inference server will be injected at packaging time automatically**.

We can create the environment as follows:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az ml environment create -f environment/sklearn-regression-env.yml
```

# [Python](#tab/sdk)

```python
base_environment = ml_client.environments.create_or_update(
    Environment(
        name=f"{model_name}-env",
        image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu22.04",
        conda_file="environment/conda.yml"
    )
)
```

## Creating a package for a custom model

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

To create a model package, we need to create a package specification. The package supports the following attributes:

| Attribute                               | Type      | Description | Required |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `target_environment_name`               | `str`     | The name of the package to create. Packages are materialized as environments is Azure Machine Learning | Yes |
| `base_environment_source`               | `object`  | The base image to use to create the package.  Yes, unless model type is MLflow. |
| `base_environment_source.type`          | `str`     | Only using another environment as the base image (`type: environment_asset`) is supported.  |  |
| `base_environment_source.resource_id`   | `str`     | The resource ID of the base environment to use. Use format `azureml:<name>:<version>` or a long resource id.   |  |
| `inferencing_server`                    | `object`  | The inferencing server to use. | Yes |
| `inferencing_server.type`               | `azureml_online` <br /> `custom` | Use `azureml_online` to Azure Machine Learning inferenginc server, or `custom` for a custom online server like TensorFlow serving, Torch Serve, etc. | Yes |
| `inferencing_server.code_configuration` | `object`  | The code configuration with the inference routine. It should contain at least one Python file with methods `init` and `run`. | When `type: azureml_online` and model type is not MLflow |
| `model_configuration`                   | `object`  | The model configuration. Use this attribute to control how the model is packaged in the resulting image. | No |
| `model_configuration.mode`              | `readonly_mount` <br /> `copy` | Indicate how the model would be placed in the package. Possible values are `readonly_mount` and `copy`. | No. Defaults to `readonly_mount`. |

__package-moe.yml__

```yml
$schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/ModelVersionPackage.json
base_environment_source:
    type: environment_asset
    resource_id: azureml:sklearn-regression-env@latest

inferencing_server: 
    type: azureml_online
    code_configuration:
      code: src
      entry_script: score.py
```

# [Python](#tab/sdk)

To create a model package, we need to create a package specification. The package supports the following attributes:

| Attribute                             | Type                  | Description | Required |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------|

| `base_environment_source`             | `BaseEnvironment`     | The base image to use to create the package. | Yes, unless model type is MLflow. |
| `base_environment_source.type`        | `BaseEnvironmentType` | Only using another environment as the base image (`type=BaseEnvironmentType.EnvironmentAsset`) is supported.  |  |
| `base_environment_source.resource_id` | `str`                 | The resource ID of the base environment to use. Use format `azureml:<name>:<version>` or a long-format resource id. |  |
| `inferencing_server`                  | `AzureMLOnlineInferencingServer` <br /> `CustomOnlineInferenceServer` | The inferencing server to use. Use `AzureMLOnlineInferencingServer` to Azure Machine Learning inferenginc server, or `CustomOnlineInferenceServer` for a custom online server like TensorFlow serving, Torch Serve, etc. <br /><br />When using `AzureMLInferencingServer` and the model type is not Mlflow, a code configuration section should be indicated containing at least one Python file with methods `init` and `run`. <br /><br />When using `CustomOnlineInferenceServer`,   | Yes |
| `model_configuration`                 | `ModelConfiguration`  | The model configuration. Use this attribute to control how the model is packaged in the resulting image. | No |
| `model_configuration.mode`            | `ModelInputMode`      | Indicate how the model would be placed in the package. Possible values are `ModelInputMode.ReadonlyMount` and `ModelInputMode.Copy`. | No. Defaults to `ModelInputMode.ReadonlyMount`. |


```python
package_config = ModelPackage(
    target_environment_name="sklearn-regression-online-pkg",
    base_environment_source=BaseEnvironment(
        type=BaseEnvironmentType.EnvironmentAsset, 
        resource_id=base_environment.id
    ),
    inferencing_server=AzureMLOnlineInferencingServer(
        code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(
            code='src', 
            scoring_script='score.py'

```azurecli
az ml model package -n $MODEL_NAME -l latest --file package-moe.yml
```

# [Python](#tab/sdk)

```python

The result of the package operation is an environment.

## Deploy model packages to online endpoints

Model packages can be deployed directly to Online Endpoint in Azure Machine Learning. Follow these steps to deploy a package to an online endpoint:

1. Let's create an endpoint to host the deployment of the package. To start with that, we need to pick a name for it:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    ```azurecli
    ENDPOINT_NAME = "sklearn-regression-online"
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    endpoint_name = "sklearn-regression-online"
    ```
    
    # [Studio](#tab/studio)
    
    TODO
    
1. Create the endpoint:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    ```azurecli
    az ml online-endpoint create -n $ENDPOINT_NAME
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    endpoint = ManagedOnlineEndpoint(name=endpoint_name)
    endpoint = ml_client.online_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)
    
    TODO

1. Create a deployment to host the model we just packaged:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    __package-deployment.yml__
    
    ```yml
    $schema: https://azuremlschemas.azureedge.net/latest/managedOnlineDeployment.schema.json
    name: with-package
    endpoint_name: hello-packages
    environment: azureml:sklearn-regression-online-pkg@latest
    instance_type: Standard_DS3_v2
    instance_count: 1
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    deployment_package = ManagedOnlineDeployment(
        name="with-package",
        endpoint_name=endpoint_name,
        environment=model_package,
        instance_count=1
    )
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    TODO

    ---

    > [!TIP]
    > Notice how model or scoring script are not being indicated in this example. All of them are part of the package.

1. Start the deployment:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    ```azurecli
    az ml online-deployment create -f model-deployment.yml
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    ml_client.online_deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment_package).result()
    ```

    # [Studio](#tab/studio)

    TODO

1. At this point, the deployment is ready to be consumed. We can test how it is working:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    ```azurecli
    az ml online-endpoint invoke -n $ENDPOINT_NAME -d with-package -f sample-request.json
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    ml_client.online_endpoints.invoke(
        endpoint_name=endpoint_name, 
        deployment_name="with-package", 
        request_file="sample-request.json"
    )
    ```

## Deploy model packages to Azure App Service

Model packages can be deployed outside of Azure Machine Learning if needed. Follow these steps to package and deploy a model in an Azure App Service:


1. To guarantee portability, you only need to ensure that the **model configuration** in your package has the mode set to **copy**. That means that the model itself is copied inside of the generated docker image instead of referenced from the model registry in Azure Machine Learning.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    __package-azure-app.yml__

    ```yml
    $schema: http://azureml/sdk-2-0/ModelVersionPackage.json
    base_environment_source:
        type: environment_asset
        resource_id: azureml:sklearn-regression-env@latest
    target_environment_name: sklearn-regression-docker-pkg
    inferencing_server: 
        type: azureml_online
        code_configuration:
          code: src
          entry_script: score.py
    model_configuration:
      mode: copy
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    package_config = ModelPackage(
        target_environment_name="sklearn-regression-online-pkg",
        base_environment_source=BaseEnvironment(
            type=BaseEnvironmentType.EnvironmentAsset, 
            resource_id=base_environment.id
        ),
        inferencing_server=AzureMLOnlineInferencingServer(
            code_configuration=CodeConfiguration(
                code='src', 
                scoring_script='score.py'
            )
        ),
        model_configuration=ModelConfiguration(mode="copy")
    )
    ```

    TODO
    
1. Let's start the package operation:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    ```azurecli
    az ml model package -n $MODEL_NAME -l latest --file package-azure-app.yml
    ```

    # [Python](#tab/sdk)
    
    ```python
    model_package = ml_client.models.begin_package(model_name, model.version, package_config)
