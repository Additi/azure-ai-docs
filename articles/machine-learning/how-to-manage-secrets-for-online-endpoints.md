# Deploy and score a machine learning model by using an online endpoint

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

In this article, you'll learn to deploy your model to an online endpoint for use in real-time inferencing. You'll begin by deploying a model on your local machine to debug any errors. Then, you'll deploy and test the model in Azure. You'll also learn to view the deployment logs and monitor the service-level agreement (SLA). By the end of this article, you'll have a scalable HTTPS/REST endpoint that you can use for real-time inference.

This template provides the basic structure of a How-to article pattern. See the
[instructions - How-to](../level4/article-how-to-guide.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

How-to is a procedure-based article pattern that show the user how to complete a task in their own environment. A task is a work activity that has a definite beginning and ending, is observable, consist of two or more definite steps, and leads to a product, service, or decision.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Use a "<verb> * <noun>" format for your H1. Pick an H1 that clearly conveys the task the user will complete.

For example: "Migrate data from regular tables to ledger tables" or "Create a new Azure SQL Database".

* Include only a single H1 in the article.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't include "Tutorial" in the H1.

-->

# "<verb> * <noun>"
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes, in customer-friendly language, what the customer will do. Answer the fundamental "why would I want to do this?" question. Keep it short.

Readers should have a clear idea of what they will do in this article after reading the introduction.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be between 1-3 paragraphs.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.

Example: In this article, you will migrate your user databases from IBM Db2 to SQL Server by using SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Db2.

-->

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info directly into the article text.

-->

<!-- 3. Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Make Prerequisites the first H2 after the H1. 

* Provide a bulleted list of items that the user needs.
* Omit any preliminary text to the list.
* If there aren't any prerequisites, list "None" in plain text, not as a bulleted item.

-->

## Prerequisites

TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. Task H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple procedures should be organized in H2 level sections. A section contains a major grouping of steps that help users complete a task. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

For portal-based procedures, minimize bullets and numbering.

* Each H2 should be a major step in the task.
* Phrase each H2 title as "<verb> * <noun>" to describe what they'll do in the step.
* Don't start with a gerund.
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation for context.
* Provide a ordered list of procedural steps.
* Provide a code block, diagram, or screenshot if appropriate
* An image, code block, or other graphical element comes after numbered step it illustrates.
* If necessary, optional groups of steps can be added into a section.
* If necessary, alternative groups of steps can be added into a section.

## "\<verb\> * \<noun\>"
TODO: Add introduction sentence(s)
[Include a sentence or two to explain only what is needed to complete the procedure.]
TODO: Add ordered list of procedure steps
1. Step 1

1. Step 3

<!-- 5. Next step/Related content------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: You have two options for manually curated links in this pattern: Next step and Related content. You don't have to use either, but don't use both.
  - For Next step, provide one link to the next step in a sequence. Use the blue box format
  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

-->

## Next step

TODO: Add your next step link(s)

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Write concepts](article-concept.md)

<!-- OR -->

## Related content

TODO: Add your next step link(s)

- [Write concepts](article-concept.md)
