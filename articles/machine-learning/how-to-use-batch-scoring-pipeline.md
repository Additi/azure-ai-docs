# How to deploy a pipeline to perform batch scoring with preprocessing (preview)

[!INCLUDE [ml v2](../../includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

In this article, you'll learn how to deploy an inference (or scoring) pipeline under a batch endpoint. The pipeline performs scoring over a registered model while also reusing a preprocessing component from when the model was trained. Reusing the same preprocessing component ensures that the same preprocessing is applied during scoring.

You'll learn to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a pipeline that reuses existing components from the workspace
> * Deploy the pipeline to an endpoint
> * Consume predictions generated by the pipeline

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer](../../includes/machine-learning-preview-generic-disclaimer.md)]

## About this example

The model will perform predictions on tabular data from the [UCI Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). In particular, this example shows you how to reuse preprocessing code and the parameters learned during preprocessing before you use your model for inferencing. By reusing the preprocessing code and learned parameters, we can ensure that the same transformations (such as normalization and feature encoding) that were applied to the input data during training are also applied during inferencing.

A visualization of the pipeline is as follows:

The files for this example are in:

```azurecli
cd endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing
```

### Follow along in Jupyter notebooks

You can follow along with the Python SDK version of this example by opening the [sdk-deploy-and-test.ipynb](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples/blob/main/sdk/python/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/sdk-deploy-and-test.ipynb) notebook in the cloned repository.


## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-batch-prereqs](../../includes/machine-learning/azureml-batch-prereqs.md)]


## Create the inference pipeline

In this section, we'll create all the assets required for our inference pipeline. We'll begin by creating an environment that includes necessary libraries for the pipeline's components. Next, we'll create a compute cluster on which the batch deployment will run. Afterwards, we'll register the components, models, and transformations we need to build our inference pipeline. Finally, we'll build and test the pipeline.

### Create the environment

The components in this example will use an environment with the `XGBoost` and `scikit-learn` libraries. The `environment/conda.yml` file contains the environment's configuration:

__environment/conda.yml__

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/environment/conda.yml" :::

Create the environment as follows:

1. Define the environment:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    __environment/xgboost-sklearn-py38.yml__
    
    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/environment/xgboost-sklearn-py38.yml" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    ```python
    environment = Environment(
        name="xgboost-sklearn-py38",
        description="An environment for models built with XGBoost and Scikit-learn.",
        image="mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/openmpi4.1.0-ubuntu20.04:latest",
        conda_file="environment/conda.yml"
    )
    ```

1. Create the environment: 

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="environment_registration" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    ```python
    ml_client.environments.create_or_update(environment)
    ```

### Create a compute cluster

Batch endpoints and deployments run on compute clusters. They can run on any Azure Machine Learning compute cluster that already exists in the workspace. Therefore, multiple batch deployments can share the same compute infrastructure. In this example, we'll work on an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster called `batch-cluster`. Let's verify that the compute exists on the workspace or create it otherwise.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="create_compute" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
compute_name = "batch-cluster"
if not any(filter(lambda m: m.name == compute_name, ml_client.compute.list())):
    print(f"Compute {compute_name} is not created. Creating...")
    compute_cluster = AmlCompute(
        name=compute_name, description="amlcompute", min_instances=0, max_instances=5
    )
    ml_client.begin_create_or_update(compute_cluster)
```

The compute may take time to be created. Let's wait for it:

```python
from time import sleep

print(f"Waiting for compute {compute_name}", end="")
while ml_client.compute.get(name=compute_name).provisioning_state == "Creating":
    sleep(1)
    print(".", end="")

print(" [DONE]")
```

---

### Register components and models

We're going to register components, models, and transformations that we need to build our inference pipeline. We can reuse some of these assets for training routines.

> [!TIP]
> In this tutorial, we'll reuse the model and the preprocessing component from an earlier training pipeline. You can see how they were created by following the example [How to deploy a training pipeline with batch endpoints](how-to-use-batch-training-pipeline.md).

1. Register the model to use for prediction:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="model_registration" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    ```python
    model_name = "heart-classifier"
    model_local_path = "model"
    
    model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(
        Model(name=model_name, path=model_local_path, type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL)
    )
    ```
    
    ---

1. The registered model wasn't trained directly on input data. Instead, the input data was preprocessed (or transformed) before training, using a prepare component. We'll also need to register this component. Register the prepare component:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="preprocessing_component_register" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    prepare_data = load_component(source="components/prepare/prepare.yml")

    ml_client.components.begin_create_or_update(prepare_data)    
    ```

    ---

    > [!TIP]
    > After registering the prepare component, you can now reference it from the workspace. For example, `azureml:uci_heart_prepare@latest` will get the last version of the prepare component.

1. As part of the data transformations in the prepare component, the input data was normalized to center the predictors and limit their values in the range of [-1, 1]. The transformation parameters were captured in a scikit-learn transformation that we can also register to apply later when we have new data. Register the transformation as follows:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="transformation_registration" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    ```python
    transformation_name = "heart-classifier-transforms"
    transformation_local_path = "transformations"
    
    model = ml_client.models.create_or_update(
        Model(name=transformation_name, path=transformation_local_path, type=AssetTypes.CUSTOM_MODEL)
    )
    ```

1. We'll perform inferencing for the registered model, using another component named `score` that computes the predictions for a given model. We'll reference the component directly from its definition.  
    > [!TIP]
    > Best practice would be to register the component and reference it from the pipeline. However, in this example, we're going to reference the component directly from its definition to help you see which components are reused from the training pipeline and which ones are new.


### Build the pipeline

Now it's time to bind all the elements together. The inference pipeline we'll deploy has two components (steps):

1. `preprocess_job`: This step reads the input data and returns the prepared data and the applied transformations. The step receives two inputs:
    - `data`: a folder containing the input data to score
    - `transformations`: (optional) Path to the transformations that will be applied, if available. When provided, the transformations are read from the model that is indicated at the path. However, if the path isn't provided, then the transformations will be learned from the input data. For inferencing, though, you can't learn the transformation parameters (in this example, the normalization coefficients) from the input data because you need to use the same parameter values that were learned during training. Since this input is optional, the `preprocess_job` component can be used during training and scoring.
1. `score_job`: This step will perform inferencing on the transformed data, using the input model. Notice that the component uses an MLflow model to perform inference. Finally, the scores are written back in the same format as they were read.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

The pipeline configuration is defined in the `pipeline.yml` file:

__pipeline.yml__

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/pipeline.yml" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
prepare_data = load_component(source="azureml:uci_heart_prepare@latest")
score_data = load_component(source="components/score/score.yml")

@pipeline()
def uci_heart_classifier_scorer(input_data: Input(type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER), score_mode: str):
    """This pipeline demonstrates how to make batch inference using a model from the Heart Disease Data Set problem, where pre and post processing is required as steps. The pre and post processing steps can be components reusable from the training pipeline."""
    prepared_data = prepare_data(
        data=input_data, 
        transformations=Input(
            type=AssetTypes.CUSTOM_MODEL, 
            path=transformations.id
        )
    )
    scored_data = score_data(
        data=prepared_data.outputs.prepared_data,
        model=Input(
            type=AssetTypes.MLFLOW_MODEL,
            path=model.id
        ), 
        score_mode=score_mode
    )

    return {
        "scores": scored_data.outputs.scores
    }
```

A visualization of the pipeline is as follows:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-batch-scoring-pipeline/pipeline-for-batch-scoring-with-preprocessing.png" alt-text="Inference pipeline showing batch scoring with preprocessing." lightbox="media/how-to-use-batch-scoring-pipeline/pipeline-for-batch-scoring-with-preprocessing.png":::

### Test the pipeline

Let's test the pipeline with some sample data. To do that, we'll create a job using the pipeline and the `batch-cluster` compute cluster created previously.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

The following `pipeline-job.yml` file contains the configuration for the pipeline job:

__pipeline-job.yml__

:::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/pipeline-job.yml" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
pipeline_job = uci_heart_classifier_scorer(
    input_data=Input(type="uri_folder", path="data/unlabeled/"),
    score_mode=Input(type="string", path="append")
)
```

Now, we'll configure some run settings to run the test:

```python
pipeline_job.settings.default_datastore = "workspaceblobstore"
pipeline_job.settings.default_compute = "batch-cluster"
```

---

Create the test job:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="test_pipeline" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
pipeline_job_run = ml_client.jobs.create_or_update(
    pipeline_job, 
    experiment_name="uci-heart-score-pipeline"
)
pipeline_job_run
```

---

## Create a batch endpoint

1. Provide a name for the endpoint. A batch endpoint's name needs to be unique in each region since the name is used to construct the invocation URI. To ensure uniqueness, append any trailing characters to the name specified in the following code.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="name_endpoint" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    endpoint_name="uci-classifier-score"
    ```

1. Configure the endpoint:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    The `endpoint.yml` file contains the endpoint's configuration.

    __endpoint.yml__
    
    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/endpoint.yml" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    endpoint = BatchEndpoint(
        name=endpoint_name,
        description="Batch scoring endpoint of the Heart Disease Data Set prediction task",
    )
    ```

1. Create the endpoint:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="create_endpoint" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```

1. Query the endpoint URI:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="query_endpoint" :::

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    ```python
    endpoint = ml_client.batch_endpoints.get(name=endpoint_name)
    print(endpoint)
    ```

## Deploy the pipeline component

To deploy the pipeline component, we have to create a batch deployment. A deployment is a set of resources required for hosting the asset that does the actual work.

1. Configure the deployment

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    The `deployment.yml` file contains the deployment's configuration.

    __deployment.yml__

    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/deployment.yml" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)

    Our pipeline is defined in a function. To transform it to a component, you'll use the `build()` method. Pipeline components are reusable compute graphs that can be included in batch deployments or used to compose more complex pipelines.

    ```python
    pipeline_component = uci_heart_classifier_scorer.pipeline_builder.build()
    ```
    
    Now we can define the deployment:
    
    ```python
    deployment = BatchPipelineComponentDeployment(
        name="uci-classifier-prepros-xgb",
        description="A sample deployment with pre and post processing done before and after inference.",
        endpoint_name=endpoint.name,
        component=pipeline_component,
        settings={
            "continue_on_step_failure": False
        }
    )
    ```
    
1. Create the deployment

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    Run the following code to create a batch deployment under the batch endpoint and set it as the default deployment.
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="create_deployment" :::
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Notice the use of the `--set-default` flag to indicate that this new deployment is now the default.

    Your deployment is ready for use.

    # [Python](#tab/python)

    This command will start the deployment creation and return a confirmation response while the deployment creation continues.

    ```python
    ml_client.batch_deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment).result()
    ```
    
    Once created, let's configure this new deployment as the default one:

    ```python
    endpoint = ml_client.batch_endpoints.get(endpoint.name)
    endpoint.defaults.deployment_name = deployment.name
    ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_create_or_update(endpoint).result()
    ```

    Your deployment is ready for use.

### Test the deployment

Once the deployment is created, it's ready to receive jobs. Follow these steps to test it:

1. Our deployment requires that we indicate one data input and one literal input.

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    The `inputs.yml` file contains the definition for the input data asset: 
    
    __inputs.yml__
    
    :::code language="yaml" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/inputs.yml" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    The input data asset definition:
    
    ```python
    input_data = Input(type=AssetTypes.URI_FOLDER, path=heart_dataset_train.id)
    score_mode = Input(type="string", default="append")
    ```

    ---
    
    > [!TIP]
    > To learn more about how to indicate inputs, see [Create jobs and input data for batch endpoints](how-to-access-data-batch-endpoints-jobs.md).
    
1. You can invoke the default deployment as follows:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="invoke_deployment_file" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    ```python
    job = ml_client.batch_endpoints.invoke(
        endpoint_name=endpoint.name, 
        inputs = { 
            "input_data": input_data,
            "score_mode": score_mode
            }
    )
    ```
    
1. You can monitor the progress of the show and stream the logs using:

    # [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)
    
    :::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="stream_job_logs" :::
    
    # [Python](#tab/python)
    
    ```python
    ml_client.jobs.get(name=job.name)
    ```
    
    To wait for the job to finish, run the following code:
    
    ```python
    ml_client.jobs.get(name=job.name).stream()
    ```

### Access job output

Once the job is completed, we can access its output. This job contains only one output named `scores`:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

You can download the associated results using `az ml job download`.

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="download_outputs" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

Download the result:

```python
ml_client.jobs.download(name=score_step.name, download_path=".", output_name="scores")```
```

Read the scored data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import glob

output_files = glob.glob("named-outputs/scores/*.csv")
score = pd.concat((pd.read_csv(f) for f in output_files))
score
```

---

## Clean up resources

Once you're done, delete the associated resources from the workspace:

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the following code to delete the batch endpoint and its underlying deployment. `--yes` is used to confirm the deletion.

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azureml-examples-batch-pup/cli/endpoints/batch/deploy-pipelines/batch-scoring-with-preprocessing/cli-deploy.sh" ID="delete_endpoint" :::

# [Python](#tab/python)

Delete the endpoint:

```python
ml_client.batch_endpoints.begin_delete(endpoint.name).result()
```

---

(Optional) Delete compute, unless you plan to reuse your compute cluster with later deployments.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az ml compute delete -n batch-cluster
```

# [Python](#tab/python)

```python
ml_client.compute.begin_delete(name="batch-cluster")
```
