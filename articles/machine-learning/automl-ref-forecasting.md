## YAML syntax

| Key | Type | Description | Allowed values | Default value |
| --- | ---- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| ``$schema`` | string | The YAML schema. If the user uses the Azure Machine Learning VS Code extension to author the YAML file, including `$schema` at the top of the file enables the user to invoke schema and resource completions. | | |
| `compute` | string | **Required.** Name of the AML compute infrastructure to execute the job on. This compute can be either a reference to an existing compute machine in the workspace *Note:* jobs in pipeline don't support 'local' as `compute`. * | 1. pattern `[^azureml:<compute_name>]` to use existing compute, <br>2.`'local'` to use local execution | `'local'` |
| ``name`` | string |  The name of the Job/Run. Must be unique across all jobs in the workspace. If not specified, Azure ML will autogenerate a GUID for the name. | | |
| `description` | string | Description of the job. | | |
| `display_name` | string | Display name of the job in the studio UI. Can be non-unique within the workspace. If omitted, Azure ML will autogenerate a human-readable adjective-noun identifier for the display name. | | |
| `experiment_name` | string | The name of the Experiment. An Experiment is like a folder with multiple runs in Azure ML Workspace that should be related to the same logical machine learning experiment. For example, if a user runs this notebook multiple times, there will be multiple runs associated with the same Experiment name. Each job's run record will be organized under the corresponding experiment in the studio's "Experiments" tab. If omitted, Azure ML will default it to the name of the working directory where the job was created. | | |
| `log_files` | object | Dictionary containing logs of AutoML job execution | | |
| `log_verbosity` | string | Different levels of log verbosity. (The verbosity level for writing to the log file. The default is INFO or 20. Acceptable values are defined in the Python logging library <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>).| `'not_set'`,`'debug'`,`'info'`,`'warning'`,`'error'`,`'critical'` | `'info'` |

The test run will get predictions using the best model and will compute metrics given these predictions. If this parameter or the `test_data_size` parameter are not specified then no test run will be executed automatically after model training is completed. Test data should contain both features and label column. If `test_data` is specified then the `target_column_name` parameter must be specified.
