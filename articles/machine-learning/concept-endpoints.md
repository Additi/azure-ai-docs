# Use endpoints for inference

[!INCLUDE [dev v2](../../includes/machine-learning-dev-v2.md)]

After you train a machine learning model or a machine learning pipeline, you need to deploy them so others can consume their predictions. Such execution mode is called *inference*. Azure Machine Learning uses the concept of __endpoints and deployments__ for machine learning inference.

Endpoints and deployments are two constructs that allow you to decouple the interface of your production workload from the implementation that serves it. 

## Intuition

Let's imagine you are working on an application that needs to predict the type and color of a car given its photo. The application only needs to know that they make an HTTP request to a URL using some sort of credentials, provide a picture of a car, and they get the type and color of the car back as string values. This thing we have just described is __an endpoint__.

Now, let's imagine that one data scientists, Alice, is working on its implementation. Alice is  well versed on TensorFlow so she decided to implement the model using a Keras sequential classifier using a RestNet architecture she consumed from TensorFlow Hub. She tested the model and she is happy with the results. She decides to use that model to solve the car prediction problem. This thing we have just described is __a deployment__.

Finally, let's imagine that after running for a couple of months, the organization discovers that the application performs poorly on images with no ideal illumination conditions. Bob, another data scientist, knows a lot about data argumentation techniques that can be used to help the model build robustness on that factor. However, he feels more comfortable using Torch rather than TensorFlow. He trained another model then using those techniques and he is happy with the results. He would like to try this model on production gradually until the organization is ready to retire the old one. We have just described __another deployment under the same endpoint__.

## Endpoints and deployments

An **endpoint**, is a stable and durable URL that can be used to request or invoke the model, provide the required inputs, and get the outputs back. An endpoint provides:

- a stable and durable URL (like endpoint-name.region.inference.ml.azure.com).
- An authentication and authentication mechanism.

A **deployment** is a set of resources required for hosting the model or component that does the actual inferencing. A single endpoint can contain multiple deployments which can host independent assets and consume different resources based on what the actual assets require. Endpoints have a routing mechanism that can route the request generated for the clients to specific deployments under the endpoint.

To function properly, __each endpoint needs to have at least one deployment__. Endpoints and deployments are independent Azure Resource Manager resources that appear in the Azure portal.

## Online and batch endpoints

Azure Machine Learning allows you to implement [online endpoints](concept-endpoints-online.md) and [batch endpoints](concept-endpoints-batch.md). Online endpoints are designed for real-time inference so the results are returned in the response of the invocation. Batch endpoints, on the other hand, are designed for long-running batch inference so each time you invoke the endpoint you generate a batch job that performs the actual work.

### When to use what

Use [online endpoints](concept-endpoints-online.md) to operationalize models for real-time inference in synchronous low-latency requests. We recommend using them when:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * You have low-latency requirements.
> * Your model can answer the request in a relatively short amount of time.
> * Your model's inputs fit on the HTTP payload of the request.
> * You need to scale up in term of number of request.

Use [batch endpoints](concept-endpoints-batch.md) to operationalize models or pipelines for long-running asynchronous inference. We recommend using them when:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * You have expensive models or pipelines that requires a longer time to run.
> * You want to operationalize machine learning pipelines and reuse components.
> * You need to perform inference over large amounts of data, distributed in multiple files.
> * You don't have low latency requirements.
> * Your model's inputs are stored in an Storage Account or in an Azure Machine learning data asset.
> * You can take advantage of parallelization.

### Comparison

Both of online and batch endpoints use the same constructs, which help you transition easily from one to the other. However, there are some differences that are important to take into account. Some of these differences are due to the nature of the work:

## Developer interfaces

Endpoints are designed to help organization operationalize production level workloads in Azure Machine Learning. They are robust, and scalable resources and they provide the best of the capabilities to implement MLOps workflows. 

Create and manage batch and online endpoints with multiple developer tools:

- The Azure CLI and the Python SDK
- Azure Resource Manager/REST API
- Azure Machine Learning studio web portal
- Azure portal (IT/Admin)
- Support for CI/CD MLOps pipelines using the Azure CLI interface & REST/ARM interfaces
