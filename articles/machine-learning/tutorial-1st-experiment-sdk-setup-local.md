# Tutorial: Set up your local computer for Azure Machine Learning

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of Azure Machine Learning (AzureML), including:

- Setting up a workspace and local (for example, laptop) ML developer environment
- Running code in the cloud using Azure ML's Python SDK
- Managing python environments to use to train a model
- Uploading data to Azure and consuming the data in your ML training

In this tutorial, you will:

> [!div class="checklist"]

> * Install the AzureML SDK
> * Set up directory structure for code
> * Create an AzureML workspace
> * Configure your local development environment
> * Set up a compute cluster

>[!NOTE]
> This tutorial is focused heavily on the AzureML features and concepts that help with __jobs-based__ machine learning tasks that have the following traits:
>
> - Python-based and
> - long running and/or
> - distributed (require many machines and processes) and/or
> - repeatable (require reproducible, auditable, and portable environment)
>
> If your machine learning tasks do not fit this profile - for example, you tend to run ad-hoc analysis with python code in a Jupyter notebook, or R code in Rstudio - **we would recommend you use the [Jupyter or RStudio functionality on a AzureML compute instance](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md)**. This will be the fastest way for you to onboard to AzureML.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure Subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try [Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.
- Familiarity with Python and [Machine Learning concepts](concept-azure-machine-learning-architecture.md). For example, environments, training, scoring, and so on.
- A local development environment - a laptop with Python installed and your favorite IDE (for example: VSCode, Pycharm, Jupyter, and so on).

## Install the AzureML SDK

Throughout this tutorial, we make use of the Azure ML Python SDK. The SDK allows us to use
Python to interact with AzureML.

You can use the tools most familiar to you - for example: conda, pip, and so on - to set up an environment to use throughout this tutorial. Install into the environment the AzureML Python SDK via pip:

```bash
pip install azureml-sdk
```

## Create directory structure for code
We recommend that you have the following simple directory set up for this tutorial:

```markdown
tutorial
└──.azureml
```

- **tutorial** (top-level directory of the project)
- **.azureml** (hidden subdirectory of tutorial):  The `.azureml` directory is used to store AzureML configuration files.

## Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace

A workspace is a top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning and is a centralized place to:

- Manage resources such as compute
- Store assets like Notebooks, Environments, Datasets, Pipelines, Models, Endpoints, and so on
- Collaborate with other team members

In the top-parent directory - `tutorial` - add a new Python file called `01-create-workspace.py` with the code below. Adapt the parameters (name, subscription ID, resource group, and location) with your preferences. You can run the code in an interactive session, or as a python file.

>[!NOTE]
> When using a local (e.g. laptop) development environment you will be asked to authenticate to your workspace using a *device code* the first time you execute the code below. Follow the on-screen instructions.

```python
# tutorial/01-create-workspace.py
from azureml.core import Workspace

ws = Workspace.create(name='<my_workspace_name>', # provide a name for your workspace
                      subscription_id='<azure-subscription-id>', # provide your subscription ID
                      resource_group='<myresourcegroup>', # provide a resource group name
                      create_resource_group=True,
                      location='<azure-region>' # provide an azure region)

# write out the workspace details to a configuration file: .azureml/config.json
ws.write_config(path='.azureml')
```

Run this code from the `tutorial` directory:

```bash
cd <path/to/tutorial>
python ./01-create-workspace.py
```

Once the above code snippet has been run, your folder structure will look like:

```markdown
tutorial
└──.azureml
|  └──config.json
└──01-create-workspace.py
```

The file `.azureml/config.json` contains the metadata necessary to connect to your AzureML
workspace - namely your subscription ID, resource group and workspace name. We'll make use
of this as you progress through the tutorial with the following:

```python
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

> [!NOTE]
> The contents of `config.json` are not secrets - it is perfectly fine to share these details.
> Authentication is still required to interact with your AzureML workspace.

## Create an AzureML compute cluster

Create a python script in the `tutorial` top-level directory called `02-create-compute.py` and populate with the following code to create an AzureML compute cluster that will auto-scale between zero and four nodes:

```python
# tutorial/02-create-compute.py
from azureml.core import Workspace
from azureml.core.compute import ComputeTarget, AmlCompute
from azureml.core.compute_target import ComputeTargetException

ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Choose a name for your CPU cluster
cpu_cluster_name = "cpu-cluster"

# Verify that cluster does not exist already
try:
    cpu_cluster = ComputeTarget(workspace=ws, name=cpu_cluster_name)
    print('Found existing cluster, use it.')
except ComputeTargetException:
    compute_config = AmlCompute.provisioning_configuration(vm_size='STANDARD_D2_V2',
                                                            max_nodes=4, 
                                                            idle_seconds_before_scaledown=2400)
    cpu_cluster = ComputeTarget.create(ws, cpu_cluster_name, compute_config)

cpu_cluster.wait_for_completion(show_output=True)
```

> [!NOTE]
> When the cluster has been created it will have 0 nodes provisioned as no jobs have been submitted. Whilst there are 0 nodes provisioned you **do not** incur costs. This cluster will scale down when it has been idle for 2400 seconds (40 minutes). If there have been no jobs running on the cluster for 40 minutes it will automatically scale down to 0, and will not incur costs. 

Your folder structure will now look as follows:

```bash
tutorial
└──.azureml
|  └──config.json
└──01-create-workspace.py
└──02-create-compute.py
```


## Next steps

In this setup tutorial you have:

- Created an Azure ML workspace
- Set up your local development environment
- Created an AzureML compute cluster.

In the next tutorial, you walk through submitting an ML script to the AzureML compute cluster.
