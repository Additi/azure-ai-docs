# Tutorial: Set up your local computer for Azure Machine Learning

In this tutorial, you complete the end-to-end steps to get started with the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK running on your local computer. This tutorial is a precursor to all other Python tutorials that want to perform them on your local computer. 

You could instead run the tutorials in a [compute instance](concept-compute-instance.md), a managed, pre-configured virtual machine (VM).  Use [Tutorial:  Set up a remote computer for Azure Machine Learning](tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup.md) if you wish to run the tutorials on the compute instance.

In this tutorial, you:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create an [Azure Machine Learning Workspace](concept-workspace.md) to use in the next tutorial.
> * Clone the tutorials notebook to your folder in the workspace.
> * Create a cloud-based compute instance with Azure Machine Learning Python SDK installed and pre-configured.


If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a free account before you begin. Try the [free or paid version of Azure Machine Learning](https://aka.ms/AMLFree) today.
