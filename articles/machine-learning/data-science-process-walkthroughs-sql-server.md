# SQL Server data science walkthroughs using R, Python and T-SQL

These walkthroughs use SQL Server, SQL Server R Services, and SQL Server Python Services to do predictive analytics. R and Python code is deployed in stored procedures. They follow the steps outlined in the Team Data Science Process. For an overview of the Team Data Science Process, see [Data Science Process](data-science-process-overview.md). 


## Predict taxi tips using Python and SQL queries with SQL Server 

The [Use SQL Server](machine-learning-data-science-process-sql-walkthrough.md) walkthrough shows you build and deploy machine learning classification and regression models using SQL Server and a publicly available NYC taxi trip and fare dataset.


## Predict taxi tips using Microsoft R with SQL Server 

The [Use SQL Server R Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt612857.aspx) walkthrough provides data scientists with a combination of R code, SQL Server data, and custom SQL functions to build and deploy an R model to SQL Server. The walkthrough is designed to introduce R developers to R Services (In-Database).

## Predict taxi tips using R from T-SQL or stored procedures with SQL Server

The [Data science walkthrough for R and SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/tutorials/walkthrough-data-science-end-to-end-walkthrough) provides SQL programmers with experience building an advanced analytics solution with Transact-SQL using SQL Server R Services to operationalize an R solution. 


## Predict taxi tips using Python in SQL Server stored procedures

The [Use T-SQL with SQL Server Python Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/tutorials/sqldev-in-database-python-for-sql-developers) walkthrough provides SQL programmers with experience building a machine learning solution in SQL Server. It demonstrates how to incorporate Python into an application by adding Python code to stored procedures.


## Next steps

Additional data science walkthroughs that execute the Team Data Science Process are grouped by the **platform** that they use:
