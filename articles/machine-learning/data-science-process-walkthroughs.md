# Team Data Science Process execution walkthroughs
These **end-to-end walkthroughs** demonstrate the steps in the Team Data Science Process for specific scenarios. They illustrate how to combine cloud, on-premises tools, and services into a workflow or pipeline to create an **intelligent application**. The walkthroughs are grouped by **platform** that they use. The following menu links to these examples:

[!INCLUDE [tdsp-walkthroughs-by-platform](../../includes/tdsp-walkthroughs-by-platform.md)]

Here are brief descriptions of what these walkthrough examples provide for each platform:

- [HDInsight Spark walkthroughs using PySpark and Scala](data-science-process-walkthrough-spark.md) These walkthroughs use PySpark and Scala on an Azure Spark cluster to do predictive analytics. 
- [HDInsight Hadoop walkthroughs using Hive](data-science-process-walkthrough-hdinsight-hadoop.md) These walkthroughs use Hive with an HDInsight Hadoop cluster to do predictive analytics.
- [Azure Data Lake walkthroughs using U-SQL](data-science-process-walkthroughs-azure-data-lake.md) These walkthroughs use U-SQL with Azure Data Lake to do predictive analytics.
- [SQL Server](data-science-process-walkthroughs-sql-server.md) These walkthroughs use SQL Server, SQL Server R Services, and SQL Server Python Services to do predictive analytics.
- [SQL Data Warehouse](data-science-process-walkthroughs-sql-data-warehouse.md) These walkthroughs use of SQL Data Warehouse to do predictive analytics.
