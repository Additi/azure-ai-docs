# Quickstart: Set up your workspace to get started with Azure Machine Learning

In this quickstart, you'll complete the steps to get started with Azure Machine Learning by creating an Azure Machine Learning workspace, then add compute resources to the workspace. The workspace is the top-level resource for Azure Machine Learning, providing a centralized place to work with all the artifacts you create when you use Azure Machine Learning.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Create the workspace

[!INCLUDE [aml-create-portal](../../includes/aml-create-in-portal.md)]

## Explore the studio

## Create compute resources

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [aml-delete-resource-group](../../includes/aml-delete-resource-group.md)]

## Next steps
