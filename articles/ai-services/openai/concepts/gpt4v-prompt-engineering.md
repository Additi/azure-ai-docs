To unlock the full potential of GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, it's essential to skillfully tailor the system prompt to your specific needs. Here are some guidelines to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of your prompts:
1.	Contextual specificity: For instance, if you're working on image descriptions for a product catalog, ensure your prompt reflects this. A prompt like “Describe images for an outdoor hiking product catalog, focusing on enthusiasm and professionalism” guides the model to generate responses that are both accurate and contextually rich. This level of specificity aids in focusing on relevant aspects and avoiding extraneous details.
2.	Task-oriented prompts: If your project involves analyzing videos for auto insurance claims, your prompt should be precisely tailored to this task. For example, “Analyze this car damage video for an auto insurance report, focusing on identifying and detailing damage.” This prompt steers the model to concentrate on elements crucial for insurance assessments, thereby improving accuracy and relevancy.
3.	Handling refusals: When the model indicates an inability to perform a task, refining the prompt can be an effective solution. More specific prompts can guide the model towards a clearer understanding and better execution of the task.
