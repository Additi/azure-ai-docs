# Content Credentials in Azure OpenAI service

Content Credentials is an open protocol developed by [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) for the purpose of labeling and identifying AI-generated images. When you use an AI model such as DALL-E to generate an image, the model attaches a content credential string in the image metadata. The content credential string can be viewed by anyone using a tool like [ContentCredentials.org](https://contentcredentials.org/verify)


Content Credentials can capture a detailed history of changes over time.

Many companies adhere to this specification https://c2pa.org/membership/

use contentcredentials.org/verify

With the improved quality of content from generative AI models, there is an increased need for transparency on the history of AI generated content. As models continue to evolve with increasingly realistic generations and editing capabilities, establishing provenance of media becomes more critical than ever before.

The Azure OpenAI service is now providing Content Credentials in image generated content to help disclose content as AI generated. This is done in collaboration with The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), a Joint Development Foundation project. Visit [C2PA](https://c2pa.org/) to learn more about this coalition and initiatives.   

> [!NOTE]
> Note: Content Credentials is currently only available through the DALL-E series models.

## What are Content Credentials?  

Content Credentials in Azure OpenAI Service provides customers with information on the history and origin of an image generated by the DALL-E series models. This is represented by an embedded manifest inside the image.  

Every image that is generated using Azure OpenAI Service contains a manifest that clearly states when and how this image was generated. This manifest is cryptographically signed by a certificate which customers can use to trace back to Azure OpenAI Service. This signature is also embedded into the manifest itself.   

The manifest will contain two pieces of information: 

1. Description: "AI Generated Image"
1. Software agent: "Azure OpenAI DALL-E"

This digital signature can help combat harms associated with producing falsified images and protecting creators by exposing the creation and manipulation of the media generated. While Content Credentials can help customers identify the origin of the media and combat such harms, it cannot determine if the media itself depicts the truth. Rather, it is a mitigation that gives customers an additional tool for media validation. For more information on how to responsible build solutions with Azure OpenAI Service image generation models, visit the [Azure OpenAI transparency note](/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?context=/azure/ai-services/openai/context/context).

 
## How do I leverage Content Credentials in my solution today? 

There are two components to using Content Credentials:  

1. Ensure that AI generated images contain Credentials 
   
   No additional set up is necessary. Content Credentials are automatically applied to all generated images from DALLÂ·E in the Azure OpenAI Service.  

   Please consider several best practices to ensure everyone who gets access to content generated by your application can access the Credentials:

2. Verify that an image has Credentials 

   Anyone can validate the Credential of an image output from the DALL-E models using this webpage contentcredentials.org/verify.
