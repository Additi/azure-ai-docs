## Deploy a web app

Once you're satisfied with the experience in Azure OpenAI studio, you can deploy a web app directly from the 
Studio by selecting the **Deploy to** button.

The first time you deploy a web app, you should select **Create a new web app**. Choose a name for the app, which will 
become part of the app URL. For example, `https://<appname>.azurewebsites.net`. 

Select your subscription, resource group, location, and pricing plan for the published app. To 
update an existing app, select **Publish to an existing web app** and choose the name of your previous 
app from the dropdown menu.
