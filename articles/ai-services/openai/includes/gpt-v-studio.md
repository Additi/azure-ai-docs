Use this article to get started using Azure OpenAI to deploy and use the GPT-4V (Visual) model. 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription. Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at https://aka.ms/oai/access. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue. 
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with the GPT-4V models deployed. The resource must be in the `SwedenCentral` or  `SwitzerlandNorth` Azure region. For more information about model deployment, see [the resource deployment guide](/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource).  

## Go to Azure OpenAI Studio

Browse to [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign in with the credentials associated with your Azure OpenAI resource. During or after the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

From the Azure OpenAI Studio landing page, select **Chat playground**.

## Playground

Start exploring OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the Azure OpenAI Studio Chat playground. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with the capabilities.

For help with assistant setup, chat sessions, settings, and panels, refer to the [Chat quickstart](/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio). 

 
## Start a chat session to analyze images 

In this chat session, you will be instructing the assistant to aid in understanding images that you input. 
1. To start, provide this prompt to guide the assistant: "You are an AI assistant that helps people find information." You can tailor the prompt the image or scenario that you are uploading. 
1. Save your changes, and when prompted to see if you want to update the system message, select **Continue**. 
1. In the chat session pane, enter the following question: "Describe this image", and upload an image. Then select **Send**.

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
