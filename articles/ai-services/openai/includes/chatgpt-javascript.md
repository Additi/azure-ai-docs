[Source code](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/openai-azure-samples/sdk/openai/openai/samples/v1-beta/javascript) 

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services?azure-portal=true)
- Access granted to the Azure OpenAI service in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access?azure-portal=true).
- [LTS versions of Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule)
- An Azure OpenAI Service resource with either a `gpt-35-turbo` or `gpt-4` series models deployed. For more information about model deployment, see the [resource deployment guide](../how-to/create-resource.md).

## Set up

[!INCLUDE [get-key-endpoint](get-key-endpoint.md)]

[!INCLUDE [environment-variables](environment-variables.md)]

## Create a Node application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

## Install the client library

Install the required client libraries for JavaScript with npm from within the context of your new directory:

```console
npm install openai @azure/openai dotenv
```

Your app's _package.json_ file will be updated with the dependencies.

## Create a sample application

Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a new file named ChatCompletion.js. Copy the following code into the ChatCompletion.js file.

```javascript
const { OpenAIClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/openai");

// Load the .env file if it exists
const dotenv = require("dotenv");
dotenv.config();

// You will need to set these environment variables or edit the following values
const endpoint = process.env["ENDPOINT"] || "<endpoint>";
const azureApiKey = process.env["AZURE_API_KEY"] || "<api key>";

async function main() {
  console.log("== Chat Completions Sample ==");

  const client = new OpenAIClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(azureApiKey));
  const deploymentId = "gpt-35-turbo"; //set this value to match your model deployment name
  const result = await client.getChatCompletions(deploymentId, [
    { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
    { role: "user", content: "Does Azure OpenAI support customer managed keys?" },
    { role: "assistant", content: "Yes, customer managed keys are supported by Azure OpenAI?" },
    { role: "user", content: "Do other Azure AI services support this too?" },
  ]);

  for (const choice of result.choices) {
    console.log(choice.message);
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("Error occurred:", err);
});

module.exports = { main };
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials like [Azure Key Vault](../../../key-vault/general/overview.md). For more information about credential security, see the Azure AI services [security](../../security-features.md) article.

Run the script with the following command:

```cmd
node.exe ChatCompletion.js
```

## Output

```output
== Chat Completions Sample ==
{
  content: 'Yes, several other Azure AI services also support customer managed keys for enhanced security and control over encryption keys.',
  role: 'assistant'
}
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you can delete the resource. Before deleting the resource, you must first delete any deployed models.

- [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)
