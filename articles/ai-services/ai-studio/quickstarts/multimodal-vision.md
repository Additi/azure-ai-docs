# Quickstart: Get started using GPT-4V on your images and video with the Azure AI Studio 

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

Use this article to get started using Azure AI Studio to deploy and test the GPT-4(V)ision model. 

GPT-4V and Azure AI Vision offer advanced functionality including:

- Optical character recognition (OCR): Extracts text from images and combines it with the user's prompt and image to expand the context. 
- Object visualization: Complements the GPT-4V text response with object grounding and outlines salient objects in the input images.
- Video chat: GPT-4V can answer questions by retrieving the video frames most relevant to the user's prompt.

Additional usage fees may apply for using GPT-4V with Azure AI Vision functionality.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

You need:
- An Azure OpenAI resource with the GPT-4V models deployed in one of the regions that support GPT-4V: Australia East, Switzerland North, Sweden Central, West US, and East US.
- For enhanced image and video chat, you also need an Azure AI Vision resource in one of the regions that support GPT-4V: Australia East, Switzerland North, Sweden Central, West US, and East US.

## Start a chat session to analyze images or video

You need an image to complete the image quickstarts. You can use the following image or any other image you have available. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/playground/car-accident.png" alt-text="Image of a car accident that can be used to complete the quickstart." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/playground/car-accident.png":::

You need a video up to three minutes in length to complete the video quickstart. 

# [Image analysis chat](#tab/image-chat)

In this chat session, you instruct the assistant to aid in understanding images that you input. 

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Studio](https://aka.ms/aistudio).
1. Select **Build** from the top menu and then select **Playground** from the collapsible left menu.
1. Make sure that **Chat** is selected from the **Mode** dropdown. Select your deployed GPT-4V model from the **Deployment** dropdown. Under the chat session text box, you should now see the option to select a file.
