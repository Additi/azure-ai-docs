# Content filtering in Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

Azure AI Studio includes a content filtering system that works alongside core models. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content filtering system isn't applied to prompts and completions processed by the Whisper model in Azure OpenAI Service. Learn more about the [Whisper model in Azure OpenAI](../../openai/concepts/models.md#whisper-preview).

This system is powered by Azure AI Content Safety, and now works by running both the prompt and completion through an ensemble of classification models aimed at detecting and preventing the output of harmful content. The content filtering system detects and takes action on specific categories of potentially harmful content in both input prompts and output completions. Variations in API configurations and application design might affect completions and thus filtering behavior.

The content filtering models have been trained and tested on the following languages: English, German, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese. However, the service can work in many other languages, but the quality can vary. In all cases, you should do your own testing to ensure that it works for your application.

Users now could create a content filter or use the default content filter for Azure OpenAI model deployment, and could also use a default content filter for other text models curated by Azure Machine Learning in the model catalog. The custom content filter for those models aren't yet available. Models available through Models as a Service will have content filtering enabled by default and can't be configured.

The following sections provide information about the content filtering categories, the filtering severity levels and their configurability, and API scenarios to be considered in application design and implementation. 

## Content filtering categories

The content filtering system integrated in the Azure OpenAI Service contains neural multi-class classification models aimed at detecting and filtering harmful content; the models cover four categories (hate, sexual, violence, and self-harm) across four severity levels (safe, low, medium, and high). Content detected at the 'safe' severity level is labeled in annotations but isn't subject to filtering and isn't configurable.

### Categories

|Category|Description|
|--------|-----------|
| Hate   |The hate category describes language attacks or uses that include pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or identity group based on certain differentiating attributes of these groups including but not limited to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, religion, immigration status, ability status, personal appearance, and body size. |
| Sexual | The sexual category describes language related to anatomical organs and genitals, romantic relationships, acts portrayed in erotic or affectionate terms, physical sexual acts, including those portrayed as an assault or a forced sexual violent act against one’s will, prostitution, pornography, and abuse. |
| Violence | The violence category describes language related to physical actions intended to hurt, injure, damage, or kill someone or something; describes weapons, etc.   |
| Self-Harm | The self-harm category describes language related to physical actions intended to purposely hurt, injure, or damage one’s body, or kill oneself.|

### Severity levels

|Category|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|Safe    | Content might be related to violence, self-harm, sexual, or hate categories but the terms are used in general, journalistic, scientific, medical, and similar professional contexts, which are appropriate for most audiences. |
|Low | Content that expresses prejudiced, judgmental, or opinionated views, includes offensive use of language, stereotyping, use cases exploring a fictional world (for example, gaming, literature) and depictions at low intensity.|
| Medium | Content that uses offensive, insulting, mocking, intimidating, or demeaning language towards specific identity groups, includes depictions of seeking and executing harmful instructions, fantasies, glorification, promotion of harm at medium intensity. |
|High | Content that displays explicit and severe harmful instructions, actions, damage, or abuse; includes endorsement, glorification, or promotion of severe harmful acts, extreme or illegal forms of harm, radicalization, or nonconsensual power exchange or abuse.|

## Configurability (preview)

The default content filtering configuration is set to filter at the medium severity threshold for all four content harm categories for both prompts and completions. That means that content that is detected at severity level medium or high is filtered, while content detected at severity level low isn't filtered by the content filters. The configurability feature is available in preview and allows customers to adjust the settings, separately for prompts and completions, to filter content for each content category at different severity levels as described in the table below:

| Severity filtered | Configurable for prompts | Configurable for completions | Descriptions |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|
| Low, medium, high | Yes | Yes | Strictest filtering configuration. Content detected at severity levels low, medium and high is filtered.|
| Medium, high      | Yes | Yes | Default setting. Content detected at severity level low isn't filtered, content at medium and high is filtered.|
| High              | If approved<sup>1</sup>| If approved<sup>1</sup> | Content detected at severity levels low and medium isn't filtered. Only content at severity level high is filtered. Requires approval<sup>1</sup>.|
| No filters | If approved<sup>1</sup>| If approved<sup>1</sup>| No content is filtered regardless of severity level detected. Requires approval<sup>1</sup>.|

<sup>1</sup> For Azure Open AI models, only customers who have been approved for modified content filtering  have full content filtering control, including configuring content filters at severity level high only or turning off content filters.
