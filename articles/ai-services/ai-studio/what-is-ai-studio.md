# What is Azure AI Studio?

Azure AI Studio brings together capabilities from across multiple Azure AI services. You can build generative AI applications on an enterprise-grade platform. Directly from the studio you can interact with a project code-first via the Azure AI SDK and Azure AI CLI. 

Azure AI Studio is a trusted and inclusive platform that empowers developers of all abilities and preferences to innovate with AI and shape the future. Seamlessly explore, build, test, and deploy using cutting-edge AI tools and ML models, grounded in responsible AI practices. Efficiently develop innovative, LLM-powered generative AI solutions with the foundations you need, including out-of-the-box and customizable toolkits to build copilots and “intelligent search,” “speech analytics,” and content generation applications. 

With Azure AI Studio, you can evaluate large language model (LLM) responses, pinpoint areas for fine-tuning, and orchestrate prompt application components with prompt flow for better performance. With clear cost and billing, the platform facilitates scalability, transforming proof of concepts into full-fledged production with ease. Continuous monitoring and refinement supports long-term success.  

## Benefits


- Work in VS Code. Move seamlessly between Azure AI studio and VS Code Web, fully synced at all times.



## Getting around in Azure AI Studio

The Azure AI Studio is organized into four main sections: [Home](#home), [Explore](#explore), [Build](#build), and [Manage](#manage).

### Home

The introduction to Azure AI, with information about what's new, access to any existing projects, a curated selection of Azure AI experiences, and links to learning resources. 

### Explore

This is where you can find a model, service, or solution to start working on. The goal is that you can find, and try, all of Azure AI from here. Explore is stateless, so when you want to save settings and assets such as data you create a project and continue on the [Build](#build) page. 

- Growing suite of tools, patterns, and guidance on how to build with AI so that enterprise can scale PoCs with a paved path to full production
- Guidance about how to select the right models and tools based on your use case.
- Test AI solutions with your app code and data and receive guidance on standardized methods to evaluate the model, prompt, and overall application pipeline.
- The try-out and model catalog cards provide an easy way to spin up a new project or add to an existing project.

### Build

Developers will spend most time here. Some assets can be shared across projects, so a flow or content safety filter created in one project can be used by another. Your dataset or index can be shared. The custom projects from AI Services are here.

- Simplified development of large language model (LLM) solutions and copilots with end-to-end app templates and prompt samples for common use cases.  
- Work in VS Code. Move seamlessly between Azure AI studio and VS Code Web, fully synced at all times.
- Orchestration tools such as pre-built templates, prompt flow, LangChain, and Semantic Kernel.
- Orchestration framework to handle the complex mapping of functions and code between LLMs, tools, custom code, prompts, data, search indexes, etcetera.  
- Deploy infrastructure as code with your app code and desire version control and code management support 
- Evaluate, deploy, and continuously monitor your AI application and app performance 

### Manage

Admins will mainly use this section to look at access control, usage, billing, etcetera.

- Centralized backend infrastructure to reduce complexity for developers
- A single Azure AI resource for enterprise configuration, unified data story, and built-in governance

## Pricing and Billing

Using Azure AI Studio also incurs cost associated with the underlying services, to learn more read [Plan and manage costs for Azure AI services](./how-to/costs-plan-manage.md).

## Region availability

Azure AI Studio is currently available in all regions where Azure OpenAI Service is available. To learn more, see [Azure global infrastructure - Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cognitive-services).

## How to get access

You can sign in to Azure AI Studio if your Azure subscription has been granted access to the Azure OpenAI service. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access). You'll receive a follow-up email when your subscription has been added.
