# What is Azure AI Studio?

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](./includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

Azure AI Studio brings together capabilities from across multiple Azure AI services. You can build generative AI applications on an enterprise-grade platform. Directly from the studio you can interact with a project code-first via the Azure AI SDK and Azure AI CLI. 

Azure AI Studio is a trusted and inclusive platform that empowers developers of all abilities and preferences to innovate with AI and shape the future. Seamlessly explore, build, test, and deploy using cutting-edge AI tools and ML models, grounded in responsible AI practices. Efficiently develop innovative, LLM-powered generative AI solutions with the foundations you need, including out-of-the-box and customizable toolkits to build copilots and “intelligent search,” “speech analytics,” and content generation applications. 

With Azure AI Studio, you can evaluate LLM responses, pinpoint areas for fine-tuning, and orchestrate prompt application components with prompt flow for better performance. The platform facilitates scalability, transforming Proof of Concepts (PoCs) into full-fledged production with ease. Continuous monitoring and refinement supports long-term success.  

## Benefits

- Accessible and inclusive UI accommodates developers of different preferences and abilities, allowing everyone to do their best work 
- Developers can move seamlessly between UI and code 
- A variety of orchestration tools (e.g. pre-built templates, prompt flow, LangChain, etc.) for popular tooling combinations, including copilots (e.g. “intelligent search,” “speech analytics,” content generation applications, and more) 
- Evaluate LLM responses and customize models with fine-tuning opportunities using prompt flow 
- Growing suite of tools, patterns, and guidance on how to build with AI so that enterprise can scale PoCs with a paved path to full production (Tools include responsible AI, automated evaluation at scale, best practices for indexing data, etc.) 

## What are the benefits of Azure AI Studio?

Azure AI Studio provides:
- Accessible and inclusive UI accommodates developers of different preferences and abilities, allowing everyone to do their best work
- Developers can move seamlessly between UI and code 
- Centralized backend infrastructure to reduce complexity for developers
- A single Azure AI resource for enterprise configuration, unified data story, and built-in governance
- Simplified development of large language model (LLM) solutions and copilots with end-to-end app templates and prompt samples for common use cases
- Evaluate generative AI application responses and pinpoint fine-tuning opportunities
- Guidance about how to select the right models and tools based on your use case
- An orchestration framework to handle the complex mapping of functions and code between LLMs, tools, custom code, prompts, data, search indexes, etcetera.   
- Deploy infrastructure as code with your app code and desire version control and code management support 
- Test AI solutions with your app code and data and receive guidance on standardized methods to evaluate the model, prompt, and overall application pipeline 
- Follow a recommended process to get to production  
- Release and monitor your AI model and app performance 
- Growing suite of tools, patterns, and guidance on how to build with AI so that enterprise can scale PoCs with a paved path to full production. Tools include (among others) responsible AI, automated evaluation at scale, and best practices for indexing data.  

## Getting around in Azure AI Studio

The Azure AI Studio is organized into four main sections: Home, Explore, Build, and Manage.

### Home

The introduction to Azure AI, with a ‘What’s New’, then any existing projects, and finally a curated selection of Azure AI experiences. 

### Explore

This is where you can find a model, service, or solution to start working on. The goal is that you can find, and try, all of Azure AI from here. Explore is stateless, so when you want to save settings, data etc you create a Project and continue in Build. The Try-Outs and Model-Catalog cards give an easy way to ‘deploy to project’ or ‘add to project’.

### Build

Developers will spend most time here. Some assets can be shared across projects, so a flow or content safety filter created in one project can be used by another. Your dataset or index can be shared. The custom projects from AI Services are here.

### Manage

Admins will mainly use this section to look at access control, usage, billing, etcetera.

## Pricing and Billing

Using Azure AI Studio also incurs cost associated with the underlying services, to learn more read [Plan and manage costs for Azure AI services](./how-to/costs-plan-manage.md).

## Region availability

Azure AI Studio is currently available in all regions where Azure OpenAI Service is available. To learn more, see [Azure global infrastructure - Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cognitive-services).

## How to get access

You can sign in to Azure AI Studio if your Azure subscription has been granted access to the Azure OpenAI service. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI Service by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access). You'll receive a follow-up email when your subscription has been added.
