# Get batch synthesis

To retrieve the status of a batch synthesis job, make an HTTP GET request using the URI as shown in the following example. 

Replace `YourSynthesisId` with your batch synthesis ID, `YourSpeechKey` with your Speech resource key, and `YourSpeechRegion` with your Speech resource region.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X GET "https://YourSpeechRegion.customvoice.api.speech.microsoft.com/api/texttospeech/3.1-preview1/batchsynthesis/talkingavatar/YourSynthesisId" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSpeechKey"
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json

    "customVoices": {},
