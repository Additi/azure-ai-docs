# Text to speech avatar overview

The text to speech avatar system is a text to speech feature with visual capability that allows you to create synthetic videos of a photorealistic avatar speaking based on input text.

The system offers a range of prebuilt avatar choices. The voice in the synthetic video could be a prebuilt neural voice available on Azure AI Speech or the [custom neural voice](../../custom-neural-voice.md) of talent selected by you. Prebuilt text to speech avatars can be accessed through the [Speech Studio portal](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/talkingavatar) or via API. We provide both batch mode and real-time synthesis. 

The language support for text to speech avatar is the same as the language support for text to speech. For details, see [Language and voice support for the Speech service](../../language-support.md?tabs=tts).

> [!TIP]
> You can create custom text to speech avatars that are unique to your product or brand. All it takes to get started is taking 10 minutes of video recordings. If you're also creating a custom neural voice for the actor, the avatar can be highly realistic. For more information, see [What is custom text to speech avatar](./what-is-custom-tts-avatar.md).


## More about text to speech avatar features

Azure AI text to speech avatar converts text into a digital video of a photorealistic human speaking with natural-sounding voices powered by Azure AI text to speech. It offers a collection of prebuilt avatars and allows you to create a custom text to speech avatar by providing your own video recording data. The text to speech avatar video can be synthesized asynchronously or in real-time. You can build applications with the text to speech avatar through an API, and we also provide a content creation tool in Speech Studio for you to create video content without coding.

With text to speech avatar's advanced neural network models, the feature empowers you to deliver lifelike and high-quality synthetic talking avatar videos for various applications while adhering to responsible AI practices.

Here's more information about the text to speech avatar:

- **Real time avatar synthesis:** Try the [quickstart](../../get-started-text-to-speech.md) to convert text to avatar video in real-time.

- **Batch or offline video content generation:** Use [REST API](../../rest-text-to-speech.md) or [Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/talkingavatar) to generate avatar video content with text input.

- **Voice and language:** The voice of the avatar is generated by Azure AI text to speech, including [prebuilt neural voices](../../language-support.md?tabs=tts) or [custom neural voices](../../custom-neural-voice.md). And the language support is the same as the language we support with Azure AI text to speech.

## Get started

To get started with text to speech avatar, see the [How to synthesize text to speech avatar](get-started-avatar.md).

> [!TIP]
> To convert text to speech with a no-code approach, try the [Text to speech avatar tool in Speech Studio](https://aka.ms/speechstudio/talkingavatar).

## Avatar video output

Both batch synthesis and real-time synthesis resolution are 1920 * 1080, FPS is 25. Batch synthesis codec can be h264 or h265 if the format is mp4 and can set codec as vp9 if the format is `webm`; only `webm` can contain an alpha channel. Real-time synthesis codec is h264. Video bitrate can be configured for both batch synthesis and real-time synthesis in the request; the default value is 2000000; more detailed configurations can be found in the sample code.

|                  | Batch synthesis  | Real-Time synthesis |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Resolution**   | 1920 * 1080      | 1920 * 1080          |
| **FPS**          | 25               | 25                   |
| **Codec**        | h264/h265/vp9    | h264                 |

## Sample code

Sample code for text to speech avatar is available on GitHub. These samples cover the most popular scenarios:

* [Batch synthesis (REST)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples)
* [Real-time synthesis (SDK)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/js/browser)
* [Live chat with Azure Open AI in behind (SDK)](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/js/browser)

## Pricing

When you use the text to speech avatar feature, you'll be billed by the minutes of video output, and the text to speech, speech to text, Azure Open AI, or other Azure services are charged separately.

For more information, see [Speech service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/).

### Responsible AI 

We care about the people who use the AI system and the people who will be affected by it as much as we care about technology. For more information, see the Responsible AI [transparency notes](../../../cognitive-services-limited-access.md).
