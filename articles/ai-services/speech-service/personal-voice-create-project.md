# Create a project for personal voice (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Personal voice preview](./includes/previews/preview-personal-voice.md)]

Personal voice projects contain models, training and testing datasets, and deployment endpoints. You can only create a personal voice project using the custom voice API. You can't create a personal voice project in the Speech Studio.

## Create a project

To create a personal voice project, use the `Projects_Create` operation of the custom voice API. Construct the request body according to the following instructions:

- Set the required `description` property. The description can be changed later.
- Set the required `kind` property to `PersonalVoice`. The kind can't be changed later.
- Optionally, remove or replace `JessicalId` with a project ID of your choice. The case sensitive ID must be unique within your Speech resource. The ID will be used in the project's URI (and the Speech Studio URL) and can't be changed later. 
- Optionally, set the `displayName` property for the project name. The project name can be changed later.

Make an HTTP POST request using the URI as shown in the following `Projects_Create` example. 
- Replace `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key.
- Replace `YourServiceRegion` with your Speech resource region, and set the request body properties as previously described.

```azurecli-interactive
curl -v -X POST -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSubscriptionKey" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "id": "JessicaId",
  "displayName": "Project name for Jessica Voice",
  "description": "Project description for Jessica Voice",
  "kind": "PersonalVoice"
} '  "https://YourServiceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/customvoice/projects?api-version=2023-12-01-preview"
```

You should receive a response body in the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "JessicaId",
  "displayName": "Project name for Jessica Voice",
  "description": "Project description for Jessica Voice",
  "kind": "PersonalVoice",
  "createdDateTime": "2023-04-01T05:30:00.000Z"
}
```
