# Use the fast transcription API (preview) with Azure AI Speech 

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](./includes/previews/preview-feature.md)]

Fast transcription API is used to transcribe audio files with returning results synchronously and much faster than real-time audio. Use fast transcription in the scenarios that you need the transcript of an audio recording as quickly as possible with predictable latency, such as: 

- Quick audio or video transcription, subtitles, and edit. 
- Video dubbing  

> [!NOTE]
> Fast transcription API is only available via the speech to text REST API version 3.3. 

## Prerequisites

- A Speech resource in one of the regions where the fast transcription API is available. The supported regions are: Australia East, Brazil South, Central India, East US, East US 2, Japan East, North Central US, North Europe, South Central US, Southeast Asia, Sweden Central, West Europe, West US, and West US 2. For more information about regions supported for other Speech service features, see [Speech service regions](./speech-service-regions.md).
- An audio file (less than 2 hours long and less than 200 MB in size) in one of the supported formats and codecs: WAV, MP3, OPUS/OGG, FLAC, WMA, AAC, ALAW in WAV container, MULAW in WAV container, AMR, WebM, M4A, and SPEEX.

## Use the fast transcription API

Construct the request body according to the following instructions:

- Set the required `inputLocales` property. This value should match the expected locale of the audio data to transcribe. The supported locales are: en-US, es-ES, es-MX, fr-FR, hi-IN, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, and zh-CN.
- Optionally, set the `wordLevelTimestampsEnabled` property to `true` to enable word-level timestamps in the transcription results. The default value is `false`.
- Optionally, set the `profanityFilterMode` property to specify how to handle profanity in recognition results. Accepted values are `None` to disable profanity filtering, `Masked` to replace profanity with asterisks, `Removed` to remove all profanity from the result, or `Tags` to add profanity tags. The default value is `Masked`.
- Optionally, set the `channels` property to specify the number of channels in the audio file. The possible values in the `channels` list are 0 and 1. The default value is `[0,1]`. If the audio file contains multiple channels, set this property to the number of channels in the audio file.

> [!NOTE]
> The `wordLevelTimestampsEnabled`, `profanityFilterMode`, and `channels` properties work the same way as via the [batch transcription API](./batch-transcription.md).

Make a multipart/form-data POST request to the `syncTranscriptions` endpoint with the audio file and the request body properties. The following example shows how to create a transcription using the fast transcription API.

- Replace `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key.
- Replace `YourServiceRegion` with your Speech resource region.
- Replace `YourAudioFile` with the path to your audio file.
- Set the form definition properties as previously described.

```azurecli-interactive
curl --location 'https://YourServiceRegion.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/speechtotext/v3.3/syncTranscriptions' \
--header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSubscriptionKey' \
--form 'audio=@"YourAudioFile"' \
--form 'definition="{
    \"inputLocales\":[\"en-US\"], 
    \"wordLevelTimestampsEnabled\":true, 
    \"profanityFilterMode\": \"Masked\", 
    \"channels\": [0,1]}"'
```

The response will include `timestamp`, `durationInTicks`, `duration`, and more. 
- The `combinedRecognizedPhrases` property contains the full transcriptions for each channel separately. For example, everything the first speaker said is in the first element of the `combinedRecognizedPhrases` array, and everything the second speaker said is in the second element of the array. 
- Since we specified `wordLevelTimestampsEnabled` as `true`, the response will include word-level timestamps.

## Compare with the real-time API

You can compare transcription results with the [speech to text real-time API](./rest-speech-to-text-short.md). 
- The real-time API is limited to 60 seconds of audio. The fast transcription API is designed for longer audio files and returns results much faster than real-time audio.
- The real-time API doesn't support channel separation. The fast transcription API supports channel separation and returns results for each channel separately.

Here's an example request:

- Replace `YourSubscriptionKey` with your Speech resource key.
- Replace `YourServiceRegion` with your Speech resource region.
- Replace `YourAudioFile` with the path to your audio file.

```azurecli-interactive
curl --location --request POST \
"https://YourServiceRegion.stt.speech.microsoft.com/speech/recognition/conversation/cognitiveservices/v1?language=en-US&format=detailed" \
--header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: YourSubscriptionKey" \
--header "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
--data-binary YourAudioFile
```

Here's an example transcription response using the [speech to text real-time API](./rest-speech-to-text-short.md). Only the first 60 seconds of the provided audio file is transcribed to text.
