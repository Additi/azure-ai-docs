# Use personal voice (preview) in your application

[!INCLUDE [Personal voice preview](./includes/previews/preview-personal-voice.md)]

With personal voice, you can get AI generated replication of your voice (or users of your application) in a few seconds. You provide a one-minute speech sample as the audio prompt, and then use it to generate speech in any of the more than 90 languages supported across more than 100 locales.  

## Integrate personal voice in your application

Personal voice creates a voice ID based on the speaker verbal statement file and the audio prompt (a clean human voice sample longer than 60 seconds). The user's voice characteristics are encoded in the voice ID that's used to generate synthesized audio with the text input provided. The voice created can generate speech in any of the 91 languages supported across 100+ locales. A locale tag isn't required. Personal voice uses automatic language detection at the sentence level.  

Here's example SSML in a request for text to speech with the voice name and the speaker profile ID. 

```xml
<speak version='1.0' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2001/10/synthesis' xmlns:mstts='http://www.w3.org/2001/mstts' xml:lang='en-US'>
    <voice xml:lang='en-US' xml:gender='Male' name='PhoenixV2Neural'> 
    <mstts:ttsembedding speakerProfileId='your speaker profile ID here'> 
    I'm happy to hear that you find me amazing and that I have made your trip planning easier and more fun. 我很高兴听到你觉得我很了不起，我让你的旅行计划更轻松、更有趣。Je suis heureux d'apprendre que vous me trouvez incroyable et que j'ai rendu la planification de votre voyage plus facile et plus amusante.  
    </mstts:ttsembedding> 
    </voice> 
</speak> 
```

You can use the SSML via the [Speech SDK](./get-started-text-to-speech.md), [REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md), or [batch synthesis API](batch-synthesis.md).

* **Real-time speech synthesis**: Use the [Speech SDK](./get-started-text-to-speech.md) or [REST API](rest-text-to-speech.md) to convert text to speech.

* **Asynchronous synthesis of long audio**: Use the [batch synthesis API](batch-synthesis.md) (Preview) to asynchronously synthesize text to speech files longer than 10 minutes (for example, audio books or lectures). Unlike synthesis performed via the Speech SDK or Speech to text REST API, responses aren't returned in real-time. The expectation is that requests are sent asynchronously, responses are polled for, and synthesized audio is downloaded when the service makes it available.
