# What is video dubbing (preview) 

The process of replacing the original language of a video with audio recorded in a different language has long been relied upon to cater to diverse audiences. Traditionally achieved through human recording and manual post-production, dubbing is essential for ensuring that viewers can enjoy video content in their native language. However, this process comes with key pain points, including its high cost, lengthy duration, and inability to replicate the original speaker's voice accurately.
