      - question: What is the difference between the Azure AI Translator cloud service and the Azure AI Translator container?
        answer: Azure AI containers are an alternative to the Azure AI cloud services. Translator containers offer a subset of the cloud services capabilities. The core AI technology, pricing tiers, API keys, and API signature are the same between the container and the corresponding cloud services.

      - question: How do I access and use the Translator gated preview container?
        answer: To access a gated preview container, you must have a valid Azure subscription and request access to the gated preview. You can run a gated preview container if your Translator resource was created with the approved Azure subscription ID. You can't run the container until your Azure subscription is approved for [connected](https://aka.ms/csgate-translator) or [disconnected](https://aka.ms/csdisconnectedcontainers) container access.
