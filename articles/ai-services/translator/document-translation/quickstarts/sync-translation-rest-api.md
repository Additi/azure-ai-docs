# Get started with synchronous document translation

Document Translation is a cloud-based feature of the [Azure AI Translator](../translator-overview.md) machine translation service that enable you to use our REST APIs and SDKs to translate multiple and complex documents across all [supported languages and dialects](../../language-support.md) while preserving original document structure and data format.

Synchronous document translation supports immediate-response processing of single-page files. The synchronous translation process does not require an Azure Blob storage account. The final response contains the translated document and is returned directly to the calling client.

Let's get started.
