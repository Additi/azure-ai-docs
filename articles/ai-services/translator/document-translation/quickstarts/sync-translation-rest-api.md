# Get started with synchronous document translation

Document Translation is a cloud-based machine translation feature of the [Azure AI Translator](../translator-overview.md) service.  You can translate multiple and complex documents across all [supported languages and dialects](../../language-support.md) while preserving original document structure and data format.

Synchronous document translation supports immediate-response processing of single-page files. The synchronous translation process doesn't require an Azure Blob storage account. The final response contains the translated document and is returned directly to the calling client.

Let's get started.
