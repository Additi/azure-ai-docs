> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is now deprecated. On January 10, 2025, the Azure AI Vision background removal API will be retired: after this date, API calls to this service will fail.
>
> To maintain a smooth operation of your models, install the open-source [Florence 2 model](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large) and use its Region to segmentation feature, which allows for a similar background removal operation.
