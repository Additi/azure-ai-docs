[Prompt flow in Azure AI Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow) is a development tool designed to streamline the entire development cycle of AI applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). You can explore and quickly start to use and fine-tune various natural language processing capabilities from Azure AI Language, reducing your time to value and deploying solutions with reliable evaluation.

This tutorial will teach you how to use Language in prompt flow utilizing [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).                            |

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.

- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

     Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

- You need an Azure AI Studio hub or permissions to create one. Your user role must be **Azure AI Developer**, **Contributor**, or **Owner** on the hub. For more information, see [hubs](../../../ai-studio/concepts/ai-resources.md) and [Azure AI roles](../../../ai-studio/concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).
     - If your role is **Contributor** or **Owner**, you can [create a hub in this tutorial](#create-a-project-in-azure-ai-studio). 
     - If your role is **Azure AI Developer**, the hub must already be created. 

- Your subscription needs to be below your [quota limit](../../../ai-studio/how-to/quota.md) to deploy a new flow in this tutorial.
