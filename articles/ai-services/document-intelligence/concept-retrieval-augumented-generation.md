# Retrieval Augmented Generation with Azure AI Document Intelligence

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD036 -->

This content applies to: checkmark v4.0 (preview) 

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is an document generative AI solution that combines a pretrained Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT with an external data retrieval system to generate an enhanced response incorporating new data outside of the original training data. Adding an information retrieval system enables you to chat with your documents, generate captivating content, and access the power of Azure OpenAI models for your data. You also have more control over the data used by the LLM as it formulates a response.

Text data chunking strategies play a key role in optimizing the RAG response and performance. Fixed-sized and semantic are two distinct chunking methods:

* **Fixed-sized chunking**. Most chunking strategies used in RAG today are based on fix-sized text segments known as chunks. It is quick, easy, and effective with text that does not have a strong sematic structure such as logs and data. However it is not recommended for text that requires semantic understanding and precise context. The fixed-size nature of the window can result in severing words, sentences, or paragraphs impeding comprehension and disrupt the flow of information and understanding.

* **Semantic chunking**. This method divides the text into chunks based on semantic understanding that focuses on the subject or topic of a sentence. This method uses significant computational resources and is algorithmically complex. However, it has the distinct advantage of maintaining semantic consistency within each chunk.  It is particularly useful for text summarization, sentiment analysis, and document classification tasks. For example, if you are looking for a specific section in a document, you can use semantic chunking to divide the document into smaller chunks based on the section headers. This can help you to find the section you are looking for quickly and easily. An effective semantic chunking strategy yields the following benefits:

* **Efficient storage and retrieval**. Relevant semantic units of information are stored fetched rather than arbitrary snippets.
* **Preserved semantic relevance**. Retrieve passages that are contextually, linguistically, and semantically relevant to the query.
* **Enhanced interpretability** – A model is interpretable if it can take inputs and consistently produce the same outputs. The higher the interpretability, the easier it is for humans to understand why certain decisions and to trust the model's accuracy. Interpretability aids in transparency and traceability of generated responses.

## Semantic chunking for a targeted RAG response

Long sentences are challenging for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Especially when they are comprised of multiple clauses, complex noun or verb phrases, relative clauses, and parenthetical groupings. Just like the human beholder, an NLP system also needs to successfully keep track of all the presented dependencies.The goal of semantic chunking is to find semantically coherent fragments of a sentence representation. These fragments can then be processed independently and recombined as semantic representations without loss of information, interpretation, or semantic relevance. The inherent meaning of the text is used as a guide for the chunking process.

Markdown is a structured and formatted markup language and a popular input for enabling semantic chunking in RAG (Retrieval augmented generation). You can use the Markdown content from the [Layout model](concept-layout.md) to split documents based on paragraph boundaries, create specific chunks for tables, and fine-tune your chunking strategy to improve the quality of the generated responses.

## Semantic chunking with Azure AI Document Intelligence Layout model

The Azure AI Document Intelligence [Layout model](concept-layout.md) is an advanced machine-learning based document analysis API. The model offers a comprehensive solution for semantic chunking by providing advanced content extraction and document structure analysis capabilities. With this model, you can easily extract paragraphs, tables, titles, section headings, selection marks, font/style properties, key-value pairs, math formulas, QR code/barcode and more from various document types. The extracted information can be conveniently outputted to Markdown format, enabling you to define your semantic chunking strategy based on the provided building blocks.

### Benefits of using the layout model

* **Simplified processing**. You can parse different document types, such as digital and scanned PDFs, images, office files (docx, xlsx, pptx), and HTML, with just a single API call.

* **Scalability and AI quality**. The layout model is highly scalable in Optical Character Recognition (OCR), table extraction, [document structure analysis](concept-layout.md#document-layout-analysis) (paragraphs, titles, and section headings), and reading order detection.It supports [309 printed and 12 handwritten languages](language-support-ocr.md#model-id-prebuilt-layout) further ensuring high-quality results driven by AI capabilities.

* **Large learning model (LLM) compatibility**. The layout model Markdown formatted output is LLM friendly and facilitates seamless integration into your workflows. You can turn any table in a document into Markdown format and avoid extensive effort parsing the documents for greater LLM understanding.

## Get started with Azure AI Document Intelligence

**Ready to begin?**

### Document Intelligence studio

You can follow the [Document Intelligence studio quickstart](quickstarts/try-document-intelligence-studio.md) to get started. Next, you can integrate Document Intelligence features with your own application using the sample code provided.

* Start with the [Layout model](https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com/studio/layout). You need to select the following **Analyze options** to use RAG in the studio:

  **Required**

  * Run analysis range → **Current document**
  * Page range → **All pages**
  * Output format style → **Markdown**

  **Optional**

  * You can also select relevant optional detection parameters.

* Select **Save**.

:::image type="content" source="media/rag/rag-analyze-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Analyze options dialog window with RAG required options in the Document Intelligence studio.":::

* Next, select the **Run analysis** button to view the output.

### SDK or REST API

* Follow the [Document Intelligence quickstart](quickstarts/get-started-sdks-rest-api.md) for your preferred programming language SDK or REST API. Use the layout model to extract content and structure from your documents.

* You can also check out GitHub repos for code samples and tips for analyzing a document in markdown output format.

* Azure AI Document Intelligence is now integrated with Langchain as one of its document loaders. You can use it to easily load the data, output to Markdown format, and then use This [cookbook]() shows a simple demo for RAG pattern with Azure AI Document Intelligence as document loader and Azure Search as retriever in Langchain.

```

from langchain.document_loaders.doc_intelligence import DocumentIntelligenceLoader

from langchain.text_splitter import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter

# Initiate Azure AI Document Intelligence to load the document and split it into chunks

loader = DocumentIntelligenceLoader(file_path=<your file path>, api_key = doc_intelligence_key, api_endpoint = doc_intelligence_endpoint)
docs = loader.load()

# text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
headers_to_split_on = [
    ("#", "Header 1"),
    ("##", "Header 2"),
    ("###", "Header 3"),
]
text_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on)

splits = text_splitter.split_text(docs_string)
splits
```
