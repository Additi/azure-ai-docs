# ImmuneCODE Database

The ImmuneCODEâ„¢ database, which includes hundreds of millions of T-cell Receptor (TCR) sequences from over 1,400 subjects exposed to or infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as over 160,000 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-specific TCRs. This database is made freely available, and the data contained in it can be analyzed to assist with the global efforts to understand the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and develop new interventions.
