# 1000 Genomes

The Open Targets Platform has built data resource that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets.By integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform has built and scored target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships.

The Open Targets Genetics highlights variant-centric statistical evidence to allow both prioritisation of candidate causal variants at trait-associated loci and identification of potential drug targets.It aggregates and integrates genetic associations curated from both literature and newly-derived loci from UK Biobank and FinnGen and also contains functional genomics data (e.g. chromatin conformation, chromatin interactions) and quantitative trait loci (eQTLs, pQTLs and sQTLs). Large-scale pipelines apply statistical fine-mapping across thousands of trait-associated loci to resolve association signals and link each variant to its proximal and distal target gene(s) using a Locus2Gene assessment. Integrated cross-trait colocalisation analyses and linking to detailed pharmaceutical compounds extend the capacity of Open Targets Genetics to explore drug repositioning opportunities and shared genetic architecture
