# What are Azure Open Datasets (preview) and how can you use them?

[Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/open-datasets/) are curated public datasets that you can use to add scenario-specific features to machine learning solutions for more accurate models. Open Datasets are in the cloud on Microsoft Azure and are readily available to Azure Databricks, Machine Learning service, and Machine Learning Studio. You can also access the datasets through APIs and use them in other products, such as Power BI and Azure Data Factory.

Datasets include public-domain data for weather, census, holidays, public safety, and location that help you train machine learning models and enrich predictive solutions. You can also share your public datasets on Azure Open Datasets.

## Curated, prepared datasets
Curated open public datasets in Azure Open Datasets are optimized for consumption in machine learning workflows. 

Data scientists often spend the majority of their time cleaning and preparing data for advanced analytics. Open Datasets are copied to the Azure cloud and preprocessed to save you time. At regular intervals data is pulled from the sources, such as by an FTP connection to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), parsed into a structured format, and then enriched as appropriate with features such as zip code or location of the nearest weather station.

Datasets are cohosted with cloud compute in Azure making access and manipulation easier.  

Following are examples of datasets available. 

### Weather data
 
|Dataset         | Notebooks     | Description                                    |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
|[NOAA Integrated Surface Data (ISD)](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/isd) | [Pandas](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/isd/access?tab2=AzureNotebooks) <br> [Azure Databricks](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/isd/access?tab2=AzureDatabricks) | Worldwide hourly weather history data from NOAA with the best spatial coverage in North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia. Updated daily. |
|[NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS)](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/gfs) | [Pandas](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/gfs/access?tab2=AzureNotebooks) <br> [Azure Databricks](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/gfs/access?tab2=AzureDatabricks) | 15-day U.S. hourly weather forecast data from NOAA. Updated daily. |

### Calendar data

|Dataset         | Notebooks     | Description                                    |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
|[Public Holidays](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/public_holiday) | [Pandas](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/public_holiday/access?tab2=AzureNotebooks) <br> [Azure Databricks](https://publicdataset.azurewebsites.net/dataDetail/public_holiday/access?tab2=AzureDatabricks) | Worldwide public holiday data, covering 116 countries or regions from 1970 to 2099. Includes country and whether most people have paid time off. |

## Access to datasets in Azure 
With an Azure subscription you can access open datasets in the Azure portal, where the data is accessible to your machine learning solution and colocated with cloud compute resources. 

The Open Datasets site provides Python Pandas and Azure Databricks notebooks you can use to connect data to Azure Machine Learning service and Azure Databricks. Datasets can also be accessed through a Python SDK. 

## Contribute to Open Datasets
If you have a dataset to share, submit a request with a description of the dataset to [Azure Open Datasets site](https://opendatasets.azure.com).
